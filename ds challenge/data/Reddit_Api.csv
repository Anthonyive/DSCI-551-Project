I work in a web app domain, mostly writing backend HTTP services in python, and very rarely do the features I'm writing lend themselves to stateful, OO-style code.  Occasionally if I've got a very lengthy request handler that wants to cache or otherwise encapsulate data manipulation, I might make a wrapper class for that behavior and instantiate it, but that feels pretty uncommon.  More often than not, I'm just writing pure functions and stitching them together in a pseudo-functional style.

I frequent a few subreddits that I find pretty invaluable and recently noticed a few posts that I keep returning to had been deleted. The author had deleted them (and their account) for some reason, and I was pissed.

So, I wrote this tool. It allows you to save your own copy of a subreddit. It can also fetch posts that have been submitted since. I use it for safekeeping the subreddit I like, but it can also be useful for those who might want to do some data analysis, etc. 

It outputs a SQLite database so you'll need to know a little SQL to use it. The README describes how to get it running and how to use what it outputs. Feel free to create an issue if anything doesn't make sense (this is my first attempt at coding for other people).

READ ME IF YOU ARE MAKING ONE YOURSELF!!!!!!
If you're making one yourself, I highly recommend you see the GitHub repository I've provided down below. The pseudo code is not the best at explaining.

Here are the steps it takes in pseudo:

&amp;#x200B;

    Lexer(text):
     return the text turned into tokens
    
    Parser(tokens):
        loop through the tokens:
            if the token is an TT_INTEGER or TT_FLOAT:
                append new Number Sequence(token's value) to the parse result
        
        Number Sequence(value):
            find next tokens /* [0, 1] to [1, 2] for example */
            nxt = next token

            if nxt's token type is an operator:
                 find next tokens
    
                 if nxt's token type is plus or minus:
                     return the value + or - Number Sequence(next token's value)
    
                 else /* its in PEMD of PEMDAS */:
                     return Number Sequence(value %operation% next token's value)
             else:
                 return value /* no operation needed */

Hopefully this is easy to understand... lol
When I use ""next token's value"", I'm using a class to hold tokens. You can find this class in parsing.py in my GitHub repository.

2 + 2 \* 3

2 + (2 \* 3)

2 + 6

I can already see problems with it after having learnt about pep8, but the code runs and (as far as I know) you can reach the end, so I am posting it here for critiques, comments and for my fellow nerds/geeks to enjoy.

I got very frustrated coding this, but also learnt a lot of things better than when learning them in a course, and had heaps of fun making it (particularly the wall room). I would not have been able to complete this project if not for some feedback on how to build the combat function from u/binary101010 and u/totallygeek in r/learnpython, so thanks a million to you two.

41,1615356941.0,0.0,m1hvm0,t3,3.0,"Hi all,

I recently built a Django REST Framework extension library, which, by adding only two of lines of code to your django project, can extend an existing Django REST Framework API with a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) interface.

**Pypi**: [https://pypi.org/project/graph-wrap/](https://pypi.org/project/graph-wrap/)

**Github**: [https://github.com/PaulGilmartin/graph\_wrap](https://github.com/PaulGilmartin/graph_wrap)

**Highlights**:

* The dynamic nature of the build of the GraphQL layer means that you can continue to develop your existing REST based API and know that the GraphQL schema will be kept up-to-date automatically.
* Since the GraphQL layer is using the REST API under-the-hood, you can be sure that important things like **serialization**, **authentication**, **authorization** and **filtering** will be consistent between your REST view and the corresponding GraphQL type.
* You no longer need to ""over expose"" fields from nested apis - the client can make use of the GraphQL layer to fetch data they need. This can lead to significant performance boosts in certain circumstances (One of the advantages of GraphQL queries is that they solve the [n+1 problem](https://itnext.io/what-is-the-n-1-problem-in-graphql-dd4921cb3c1a) which occurs with traditional REST-based APIs).

See [Which problems does GraphWrap address](https://github.com/PaulGilmartin/graph_wrap#which-problems-does-graphwrap-address) for more.

GraphWrap was originally designed for (and still supports) [django-tastypie](https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), where it was tested on a production-scale API. The latest release (0.1.0) adds Django REST Framework. I've done fairly extensive testing locally, but haven't had the opportunity to really test how GraphWrap fairs with a production-scale Django REST Framework API. Any feedback on how well it is/is not working would be greatly appreciated!",Python,GraphWrap: extend your Django REST Framework API with a GraphQL interface with just two of lines of code.,3.0,0.72,

45,1615352621.0,0.0,m1g9c5,t3,0.0,"Hi everyone,I kind of like the fact that python doesn’t overwhelm one with so many unnecessary keywords.But still I think there would actually be quite some room for improvement.

* `class` could easily be replaced by a sort of *typed* `def`, e.g.:
  ```
  def class DeadParot(DeadBird):
      ...
  ```
  where `class` would just be the type for classes (like `int` or `str`) and 
  `DeadBird` would be the superclass as usual
* `global` and `nonlocal` I don't think are very nice.One could use the `globals` 
  and `locals` arrays for that or better even make scopes more reasonably 
  accessible anyway.
* `lambda` is really a weird choice to beginners I believe.Just use the arrow
  operator `-&gt;` to define these.
  ```
  # creates lots of spam
  spam = (n) -&gt; ""spam"" * n
  ```
  This wouldn't even conflict with its existing use for function annotations.
* `from` is only used in import statements which are kind of weird anyway.
  Instead allow a syntax like this:
  ```
  import math: sin, cos, sqrt as root # imports functions from the math module.
  ```
* `async` I would also replace by a sort of *typed* `def`, e.g.:
  ```
    def async say_spam(delay):
        asyncio.sleep(delay)
        print(""spam"")
   ```
* `elif` is a weird unpythonic keyword.Use `else if` instead it is more explicit and readable.

Changing this in a reasonably backwards compatible way is of course illusory, so this is just a little ”thought experiment”",Python,Pythons unnecessary keywords,0.0,0.18,

52,1615343281.0,0.0,m1ct39,t3,21.0," I've been working on this 2-D Computational Fluid Dynamics ""paint"" style game in Python, where the user can draw/erase obstacles in the flow field, and the game will plot the transient results in real time. I've also included convective heat transfer, so the contours you are seeing are temperature, while the white lines are the velocity vector field / quiver plot.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRqVNS3YSPI&amp;lc=UgwHSyqo3hmz4zryNqR4AaABAg&amp;ab\_channel=arkie87](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRqVNS3YSPI&amp;lc=UgwHSyqo3hmz4zryNqR4AaABAg&amp;ab_channel=arkie87)

Main goals of this were:

1. An object-oriented, fast-running, and accurate CFD simulation (such that I could use it for research/design purposes)
2. Object-orientated nature would allow me to:
   1. Have two fluid flows that are solved separately (like on two sides of a heat exchanger)
   2. Reuse parts of the code when solving something like the Adjoint equations for topological optimization

Some details about the simulation:

1. Written in Python, using Pygame for the UI/Graphics
2. Solved on single CPU core/thread (looking into running on GPU and/or on CPU in parallel)
3. SIMPLE algorithm with a staggered Cartesian grid
4. Pseudo-time stepping (does not solve to convergence at each time step)
5. Central difference discretization for convective terms obtained using deferred correction approach (no flux limiter \[yet\])
6. Solvers are Gauss-Seidel for momentum/convection and geometric multigrid for pressure (both written by me)
7. Computationally heavy code JITTED using numba

Right now, each CFD iteration takes 6 ms on a 128 x 256 grid, while each game iteration takes 25 ms, which is mostly due to quiver plotting. The display is 512 x 1028 pixels and is created via bilinear interpolation of the CFD mesh/grid points.

I am seeing general comments/feedback and/or ways to improve the program. In particular, I am looking to make it into a game with an objective, similar to those ""bridge constructor"" games (where the player builds a bridge using limited resources and then clicks a button when ready to test the bridge to see if it can hold the weight of the trucks that drive across). I imagine something similar here, where the user presses a button to inject particles (that follow the flow field) into the inlet, with the goal being to have the particles distribute evenly or end up in a certain location, or something like that. **Ideas for ""goals"" or puzzle scenarios are welcome.**",Python,"Computational Fluid Dynamics ""Paint"" Game in Python using Pygame",21.0,0.85,https://external-preview.redd.it/DEON5xEqjJ3q4m2Zl7xeNBcfEZi2FZeCsIHXD2OfmAI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4fd335130ec0a697dcf2311ec42d32d1df14001d

**CardStock** is a cross-platform tool for quickly and easily building simple, graphical desktop applications, called **stacks**, which can be made up of multiple pages called **cards**. It provides a drawing-program-like editor for building Graphical User Interfaces, and a code editor for adding event-driven python code.

It's aiming to be a modern, python-based successor to HyperCard, or at least to fill a similar niche.  I know that there have been many open source projects in the past that tried to capture the fun and simplicity of building programs in HyperCard, but in my opinion, none of them offered the open-ended possibilities and ease of use that made HyperCard such a magical-feeling tool. So in the grand open source tradition, I built my own!

If you're learning python, or just want to try out a rapid prototyping tool to quickly add a GUI for your python code, please check it out!  It includes lots of documentation, including contextual help built right into the app, and a bunch of example stacks that you can play with and extend.

It's already been really fun for me to build and use, but I'm very interested to hear other people's impressions and suggestions for further improvement.

* how to read/write various file types 
* usage of specific packages (initial setup /  commonly used operations) 
* syntax of functions 
* handy little helper functions which I re-use a lot

This helps me find things more quickly than having to look through 150pages of official documentation / tens or hundreds of stackoverflow posts and also optimizie my own implementations over time. All in all I have collected quite the collection of documentations / re-usable code I implemented over the years and regularly expand it and look things up. It is a LOT by now and I am trying to figure out a good structure/tool for it. 

So far I have structured them in a GitHub Repository - I was thinking that I am surely not the only one does this and was wondering **what tools are you using to structure your saved code snippets?** 

I was looking into [https://www.thiscodeworks.com/](https://www.thiscodeworks.com/) but I really hate the layout (e.g. in collections you only have this weird Tumblr-like dashboard and no list-view) and also the limited context I can add to code (I can use hashtags or add it to collections, but that's about it - no hierarchies or anything).",Python,Tool question - what do you use as your personal coding library?,1.0,0.57,https://external-preview.redd.it/Ue8xaar3GqiK1fSQzTK30hYiA75nleRANCm36wt-qks.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f0549b1fec3d24067f00646b245102fde09cf738

107,1615229522.0,0.0,m0d9as,t3,162.0,"Hey guys! Before I start, please take into consideration that I was self taught and this will most likely reflect on my code here and there. I never intended for Python to be my professional tool, but rather something that helps me get through life easier. Still, after all these years Python solving a whole ocean of my problems, I at least wanted to try contribute to community.

&amp;#x200B;

Few months ago I got my master's diploma and my final project was to use genetic algorithm to determine ideal regulator parameters for a DC motor controlled by 3 PID regulators.

I started from scratch and designed a very badly written genetic algorithm that had no clear structure and was prone to crashing on later generations. [It worked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fC2jhY8nNk) after I spent a lot of time fixing it, but I felt like I owed it to myself to design something I like so much in a more elegant way.

I spent a few days designing the new one with a goal of stuff being easier to organize at least, given that when you're not a good programmer, writing a large, structured code can be a hard task. I posted it on GitHub with a goal of improving it further (and I did a bit), but then some friends approached me about making a Unity game and I kind of paused on python (I'm sure I'll be back eventually). Later, I also found a job and I have tons of other problems in life and I fear that I can't invest any more time into this project at the moment.

The reason why I decided to make my own GA was because other algorithms posted on Github were less complete than mine, some had only one selection mode and some had none (for reference, I had to compare how well different selections optimized the system in question). I also had already created mathematical models for everything else, so it was easier for me to create my own GA than adapt my existing code to modules I've never used so far.

All in all, if anyone is interested on improving it, or thinks they have passion to continue the project, I will post the GitHub link and you're always free to contribute.

At the moment, the algorithm supports 4 selection modes if I'm not mistaken; no selection, ranked, proportional and elitism. It is possible to switch selections with triggers, based on generation score. It is able to filter results by score as well! It is possible to set individual chances of recombination for every rank in ranked selection, return if number of generations exceeds the limit etc. It also supports safe gens, an integer that determines how many generations aren't affected by algorithm stopping conditions. My inital plan was to design fitness functions to reduce/optimize classic functions such as integer returning functions or similar, but it's not implemented and at this point it is required to design your own fitness function and plug it into the algorithm (as shown in examples).

It is fully compatible with PyPy unless functions you design to be optimized contain numpy or similar modules that are not compatible with PyPy. I'm not much of a Linux user, but at some point I had ubuntu dual boot and gave it a run to get 3x-4x speed increase which is quite nice.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, the base turned out great! I started learning selenium in the middle of all that and just for fun created a web browser game bot. I never intended to use it in harmful ways and I'm done with that project, but I wanted to try and see if I could achieve some form of ""human-like"" behavior with genetic algorithm and it worked good in my opinion, check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6-LEPRASE)! (I want to point out that this was done on a test server and never was intended to use in the actual game)

In case you missed it, it would build defence to nearly match the desired numbers, the selection was intentionally set so it doesn't produce best results, this way the algorithm would converge faster with more ""human-like"" results!

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I think I made the introduction way too long here so I'll stop. I hope someone finds use for this, at least outside Python!

(please take note, I am not much of a GitHub user and am not aware of licensing rules. If I set incorrect licence for open source software please let me know and I'll change it)

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to point out that there are some minor inconsistencies that confuse me now (like why doesn't elitism score keep only climbing in first example), but I think it's happening due to duplicates being removed from the gene pool. Not 100% sure though.

##### Talk Abstract 
Learn to harness the power of 1,000+ production-grade &amp; scalable NLP models for 200+ languages - all available with just 1 line of Python code by leveraging the open-source NLU library, which is powered by the widely popular Spark NLP.

John Snow Labs has delivered over 80 releases of Spark NLP to date, making it the most widely used NLP library in the enterprise and providing the AI community with state-of-the-art accuracy and scale for a variety of common NLP tasks. The most recent releases include pre-trained models for over 200 languages - including languages that do not use spaces for word segmentation algorithms like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and languages written from right to left like Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, and Hebrew. All software and models are free and open source under an Apache 2.0 license.

This webinar will show you how to leverage the multi-lingual capabilities of Spark NLP &amp; NLU - including automated language detection for up to 375 languages, and the ability to perform translation, named entity recognition, stopword removal, lemmatization, and more in a variety of language families. We will create Python code in real-time and solve these problems in just 30 minutes. The notebooks will then be made freely available online.

There are times when I have a question in my mind, I want to search it on YouTube or I want to search for something on YouTube if I am not satisfied with my google search results, but it takes a lot of time to go to YouTube and then search it.

            board.press('a')
            board.release('a')
    
        with board.pressed(Key.ctrl):
            board.press('c')
            board.release('c')

API Logic Server creates an **executable backend**, *instantly*, with crud support (including filtering, sorting, pagination), and related data retrieval for every table.

It also creates a **multi-page, multi-table web app**, *instantly*, so developers can engage with business users -  early in the project - for agile iterations.

Finally, it provides a logic engine (Logic Bank) that executes **spreadsheet-like rules** \- *40X* more concise than legacy code, extensible with Python.

I have often used [urlopen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.urlopen), but recently took a deeper dive into its usage, trying to construct a function and a response object I will use in a variety of client API work.

The result is [this article](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/http-calls-in-python-without-requests-or-other-external-dependencies-5aj1). If you get a chance to read it, I welcome input.

One discussion point on which I welcome feedback: HTTP ""error"" handling when the status is other than `20x` or `30x`. At this point, I do something like this:

    try:
        with urlopen(""some.api.com"") as response:
            status = response.status
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
        if e.code in (401, 429):
            status = e.code
        else:
            raise e

Then I can deal with 401 or 429 responses downstream, in the functions that call this one.

However, I am also exploring constructing subclasses of [`BaseHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.BaseHandler), then [build an `OpenerDirector`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.build_opener) chain of handlers as appropriate. I add a method `http_error_401` to handle authorization as desired, or a method `http_error_429` to handle timeouts, then pass an instance of that custom class to `build_opener()`. I also am experimenting with building the `OpenerDirector` from scratch, by instantiating it then only calling `add_handler` with the desired classes. This appeals as it also allows me to remove the file and FTP handlers which are unnecessary and a possible security risk.

In most cases, it just makes sense to use an external library like [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/), but for those who are learning or regularly using `urlopen`, I thought this could be an interesting discussion.",Python,HTTP Calls in Python Without requests or Other External Dependencies,17.0,0.86,

I put in close to 120 hours of training through web courses similar to this over the past 2 years and I can say with certainty that this instructor is the best I've had.  The full course says its 16.5 hours.  I'm about half way through (completed 6 of 14 sections) and its covered: Basic Python Crash Course, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Data Visualization.  The course comes with Jupityr Notebooks you can download with exercises that you do after each section to help cement in what you learned.  I've already mentioned it to all my co-workers and told them they need to take this course.

At a high-level my approach is:

* Generate a leading digit (can only be 2, 4, 6, 8)
* Generate last digits for that leading digit (per [rules](http://www.shyamsundergupta.com/rare.htm))
* Generate second and second-to-last digits based on above
* Generate middle part if digits &gt; 4 by counting (this is the slow part of course, and could be sped up dramatically with the techniques in the other languages' Rosetta Code entries)

`Grand Hall`  
`NPCs: 25 generic(female),25 generic(male)`  
thus indicating that this room should contain 50 people, 25 of which are female and 25 of which are male, and the program will generate that number and put them in that room. To that end, I built a  generalized random character generator in the character module.

I open sourced a Python library and would like to have some feedback from you!

https://github.com/felipeam86/cachesql

CacheSQL is a simple library for making SQL queries with cache functionality. The main target of this library are data scientists and data analysts that rely on SQLalchemy to query data from SQL and pandas to do the heavy lifting in Python.

The key features are:

- **Speed up development cycles**: Run your queries the first time against the database, get it from cache the next times. You no longer need to wait for your queries anymore.
- **Resilience**: If you lose access to the databases, you can rely on your cached results to run your code.
- **Reproducibility**: By freezing the state of your queries results in cache, you guarantee reproducibility of your code.
- **Simplify collaboration**: By sharing the state of your cache with colleagues, you can guarantee they will get the same results as you.
- **Your development code is your production code**: When ready to launch your code in production, simply turn off the cache functionality!
- **Reduce the load on production DBs**: By using the cache, you reduce the number of times you query the DBs.
- **Fast, efficient and reliable cache**: This comes from the usage of the parquet format through pyarrow.
- **Simpler code**: No more added complexity on your code to load backups from disk or run the query if no backup exists.

If you have ever worked on ML projects, you probably know the importance of efficient storage and pipelining for large amounts of data which can't fit into memory. Tensorflow offers a great format of storage to serialize and minimalistically store data for all ML projects which is called the TFRecord format. These use Protobufs in the backend which make them much more efficient as compared to saving entire multi-dimensional arrays to a file, with an added advantage of lazily loading your data into memory as and when required. To promote the use of this storage format, I created a repository full of command line scripts to convert data from all popular domains like Audio, Text and Images (with video support coming soon) to TFRecord format. The scripts also contain support for automatic SQLite and CSV datatype parsing and buffering. Along with this, they support an option for multiprocessing and are made with minimization of memory footprint in mind.

If you are interested then please check out the repository here, give it a star if it is helpful and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestion. Thanks! :)

Casbin is a powerful and efficient open-source access control library for Python projects. It provides support for enforcing authorization based on various [access control models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security_model).

## All the languages supported by Casbin:

## Supported models

1. [**ACL (Access Control List)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list)
2. **ACL with [superuser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser)**
3. **ACL without users**: especially useful for systems that don't have authentication or user log-ins.
3. **ACL without resources**: some scenarios may target for a type of resources instead of an individual resource by using permissions like ``write-article``, ``read-log``. It doesn't control the access to a specific article or log.
4. **[RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)**
5. **RBAC with resource roles**: both users and resources can have roles (or groups) at the same time.
6. **RBAC with domains/tenants**: users can have different role sets for different domains/tenants.
7. **[ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-Based_Access_Control)**: syntax sugar like ``resource.Owner`` can be used to get the attribute for a resource.
8. **[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)**: supports paths like ``/res/*``, ``/res/:id`` and HTTP methods like ``GET``, ``POST``, ``PUT``, ``DELETE``.
9. **Deny-override**: both allow and deny authorizations are supported, deny overrides the allow.
10. **Priority**: the policy rules can be prioritized like firewall rules.

## How it works?

In Casbin, an access control model is abstracted into a CONF file based on the **PERM metamodel (Policy, Effect, Request, Matchers)**. So switching or upgrading the authorization mechanism for a project is just as simple as modifying a configuration. You can customize your own access control model by combining the available models. For example, you can get RBAC roles and ABAC attributes together inside one model and share one set of policy rules.

The most basic and simplest model in Casbin is ACL. ACL's model CONF is:

```ini
# Request definition
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

# Policy definition
[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act

# Policy effect
[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

# Matchers
[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act

```

An example policy for ACL model is like:

```
p, alice, data1, read
p, bob, data2, write
```

It means:

- alice can read data1
- bob can write data2

We also support multi-line mode by appending '\\'  in the end:  

```ini
# Matchers
[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj \ 
  &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act
```

Further more, if you are using ABAC,  you can try operator `in` like following in Casbin **golang** edition (jCasbin and Node-Casbin are not supported yet):

```ini
# Matchers
[matchers]
m = r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act || r.obj in ('data2', 'data3')
```

But you **SHOULD** make sure that the length of the array is **MORE** than **1**, otherwise there will cause it to panic.

For more operators, you may take a look at [govaluate](https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate)

## Features

What Casbin does:

1. enforce the policy in the classic ``{subject, object, action}`` form or a customized form as you defined, both allow and deny authorizations are supported.
2. handle the storage of the access control model and its policy.
3. manage the role-user mappings and role-role mappings (aka role hierarchy in RBAC).
4. support built-in superuser like ``root`` or ``administrator``. A superuser can do anything without explict permissions.
5. multiple built-in operators to support the rule matching. For example, ``keyMatch`` can map a resource key ``/foo/bar`` to the pattern ``/foo*``.

What Casbin does NOT do:

1. authentication (aka verify ``username`` and ``password`` when a user logs in)
2. manage the list of users or roles. I believe it's more convenient for the project itself to manage these entities. Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container. However, Casbin stores the user-role mapping for the RBAC scenario. 

## Installation

```
pip install casbin
```

## Documentation

https://casbin.org/docs/en/overview

## Online editor

You can also use the online editor (http://casbin.org/editor/) to write your Casbin model and policy in your web browser. It provides functionality such as ``syntax highlighting`` and ``code completion``, just like an IDE for a programming language.

## Tutorials

https://casbin.org/docs/en/tutorials

## Get started

1. New a Casbin enforcer with a model file and a policy file:

```python
import casbin
e = casbin.Enforcer(""path/to/model.conf"", ""path/to/policy.csv"")
```

Note: you can also initialize an enforcer with policy in DB instead of file, see [Persistence](#persistence) section for details.

2. Add an enforcement hook into your code right before the access happens:

```python
sub = ""alice""  # the user that wants to access a resource.
obj = ""data1""  # the resource that is going to be accessed.
act = ""read""  # the operation that the user performs on the resource.

if e.enforce(sub, obj, act):
    # permit alice to read data1
    pass
else:
    # deny the request, show an error
    pass
```

3. Besides the static policy file, Casbin also provides API for permission management at run-time. For example, You can get all the roles assigned to a user as below:

```python
roles = e.get_roles_for_user(""alice"")
```

See [Policy management APIs](#policy-management) for more usage.

4. Please refer to the ``tests`` files for more usage.

## Policy management

Casbin provides two sets of APIs to manage permissions:

- [Management API](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/management_api.go): the primitive API that provides full support for Casbin policy management. See [here](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/management_api_test.go) for examples.
- [RBAC API](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/rbac_api.go): a more friendly API for RBAC. This API is a subset of Management API. The RBAC users could use this API to simplify the code. See [here](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/rbac_api_test.go) for examples.

We also provide a web-based UI for model management and policy management:

160,1615069581.0,0.0,lz2ljw,t3,13.0,"I created [C is for Camera](https://github.com/evildmp/C-is-for-Camera), a representation of a Canonet G-III QL17 in Python ([here's the documentation](https://c-is-for-camera.readthedocs.io/)).

It's a pure Python model of the physical sub-systems of a camera and their interactions. So far it's at a fairly high level - I haven't yet got down to the level of individual springs and levers yet.

You can do things like advance the film, release the shutter, meter the scene with the built-in light meter (if the camera has a battery of course) and even spoil your film if you make the mistake of opening the back in daylight.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; from camera import Camera
    &gt;&gt;&gt; c = Camera()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; c.film_advance_mechanism.advance()
    On frame 0 (of 24)
    Advancing film
    On frame 1 (of 24)
    Cocking shutter
    Cocked
    &gt;&gt;&gt; c.shutter.trip()
    Shutter openening for 1/128 seconds
    Shutter closes
    Shutter uncocked
    'Tripped'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; c.back.open()
    Opening back
    Resetting frame counter to 0
    'Film is ruined'

I spend quite a bit of my time repairing old cameras. To me they feel like computer programs encoded into physical objects, and figuring out how a mechanism works  feels like working out how code works (but more fun).

The Canonet G-III QL17 is one of my favourites. One of my reasons for writing this code is to appreciate the intricate mechanical logic embodied in the machine.

The program shows a board with the starting position and each time you make a move, it brings up the wikibooks article for that opening if there is one.

Screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/D1bXTOA.png

Video: https://i.imgur.com/QjnLMfQ.mp4

The idea is that it'll give you a feel for the openings because you can see a pretty in-depth analysis for each opening as you play through each move.

I'm hoping this can help myself and others improve their opening skills.

Right now I'm still scraping wikibooks for the articles (have every opening up to depth 5 so far) and the GUI still has a few crucial elements missing such as board coordinates and forward and back buttons.

I was considering adding pre-calculated engine scores for each opening but I don't think that'd be of much use to anyone.

This will be completely free software and I'll be releasing a first version soon.

I've been looking for some sort of benchmark but I just can't seem to find any. I was hoping someone else has some experience with this thing and could help me out.

I'm working on a relatively small project, and I want to create a RESTful API server in Python. I was initially going to use FastAPI and Tortoise ORM, after seeing some of the benchmarks, but getting to learn a new framework and all the boilerplate I've to write, doesn't seem worth it! DRF can save a lot of development time and I've already worked with it on almost a dozen of projects.

However, as far as I know, DRF makes no use of asyncio, and without an async ORM, it really doesn't have much use for it, anyway. But I'm still wondering if ASGI can improve its performance.

My project doesn't involve WebSockets (at least for now), so I really have no use for other features that depend on ASGI (like Channels). For me, it comes down to which one performs better for a RESTful API server.

Greatly appreciate the help.",Python,Does ASGI improve the performance of DRF?,6.0,0.75,

This is my first ever Python package distributed on PyPi! BetterGitCLI is a CLI program wrapped around PyGitHub and the official GitHub REST API, which allows users to perform multiple actions such as managing repositories, their account details, SSH keys and more, straight from their shell, without having to remember commands!

It is a project that I want to actively continue developing, but am also hoping for contributions from the r/Python community! So if you spot a bug, or want to add a feature, feel free to open a PR!

The code is on my GitHub-&gt; [PiotrRut/BetterGitCLI](https://github.com/PiotrRut/BetterGitCLI), and the package is available also on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/bettergitcli/) ! Also, have a look at some screenshots below! 

I would also appreciate if you left a ⭐️ on the repository page if you like the project and want to see more updates!

If you don't know what mkdocstrings is: it's the equivalent of the [autodoc Sphinx extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html), but for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a Markdown static site generator. It works differently though, and supports multiple languages by design (not only Python). Someone actually wrote a [very good handler for the Crystal language](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/crystal), and another user on GitHub recently expressed their interest for writing one for Go.

I also recently moved the repository into its own organization on GitHub, https://github.com/mkdocstrings, and version 0.15.0 was released with some new features, bug fixes and performance improvements (check out the [changelog](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/changelog/)). The ""autorefs"" or ""cross-references to headings"" functionality was also extracted into its own MkDocs plugin called [mkdocs-autorefs](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/autorefs).

I wanted to share all this here, in the hope of getting some more feedback from users and non-users. For example: did you consider using MkDocs to document a project? is there something missing in mkdocstrings that prevents you from switching to MkDocs? Is there a feature you absolutely need? Would you use mkdocstrings to document the sources of a project using multiple languages, like Python+Javascript?

The one feature I absolutely want myself in the ""inter-docs"" references: automatic links to other project's documentation.

However, when simply reading source code it can be hard to see the forest from the  trees, which is why I've created a small library for visualising source code as a graph of dependencies between variables, functions, classes and such. Best to show some output right away:

[sphinx-autodoc-typehints](https://preview.redd.it/ywtfafx2d7l61.png?width=1033&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7b7f6507f396960ea2e7628e4cef08956b6df3f)

The example was generated from a single-file 3rd-party Sphinx extension ""sphinx-autodoc-typehints"". It shows clear structure: a single top level function with a clean processing hierarchy. *Pyfactor* provides additional analysis and visual queues. The shape of a node is determined by the type: function, class, variable... Nodes with disproportionately many connections are marked in red, purple ones are waypoints - meaning their children are only accessed via that node (see complete [legend](https://pyfactor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html#legend)). Such nodes could be perfect for extracting into modules. For a first-time reader this is very insightful and intuitive when compared to reading 400+ loc thouroughly.

You can find more examples of popular libraries in our [RTD gallery](https://pyfactor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html), or try it out on your own sources by installing on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyfactor/). The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/felix-hilden/pyfactor). Fresh additions to the library are docstring tooltips, waypoint node and bridge analysis (the purple nodes and red edges), and collapsing waypoint nodes for removing detail. Thanks to u/dd2718 for the awesome suggestions!

This library came about when I tried to introduced myself to Black's single-file code base - [7000 lines of horror](https://pyfactor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/black.html). I'm not here to diss Black or its contributors, 7k loc is more than enough to be complex anyway, but the graph reveals that complexity at a glance. My hope is that it will be particularly useful for those that need to get an understanding of a code base fast, newer programmers that want to understand their own code and how to make it better, and as a tool for refactoring in general. It's no miracle worker, but I think it could have potential as a tool for making the right decisions.

With MLJAR you don't need to worry about data preprocessing or algorithm selection. You simply call `fit(X, y)` on your data, and the model is trained. You want to compute predictions: just call `predict(X)`.


The package is perfect for training production-ready ML pipelines. Why?
Because it can search for ML pipelines under the prediction time constraint on a single sample. 


All constructed ML pipelines are transparent to the user and logged with `README.md` model cards.

I'm also developing a wearable keyboard to use with it, [more info on it](https://www.parallelinnov.com/palm-pro-wearable-keyboard/). What makes Roam special is that it uses [bidirectional links](https://www.amplenote.com/blog/bidirectional_note_linking_and_an_offer_for_roam_exporters) in its notes. If I could make an app that incorporates this concept, I could take and view notes on the go with an optimal organization system.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/8iJH6zP.png) is the rough model of the app I plan on making. 

I know python isn't the best language for mobile development, but it's all I know right now. Beeware seems to be a good option as they just released some helpful documentation last month.

[Yarc](https://github.com/xeust/yarc/blob/master/note.py) incorporates bidirectional links and is partially written in python, so I can look it over to help with the structure. Emacs org-roam (A Roam clone) incorporates this concept too, and they use sqlite to manage the files. I already have a bit of experience with sqlite in python, so I don't think that part should be too hard. What will be hard is the mechanics of how bi-directional links work. Something needs to make sure all the files update the link names if a link is changed, and update the linked references every time a new one is created. I think I can figure out the app layout on my own. I think I want to store the files locally so that I don't have to be connected to the internet. And then I have to find a way to get the notes off of the app and onto my computer every once in a while, but I'll save that for later.

I keep it simple and introduce two popular tools (Tesseract and OCRmyPDF), and then demo how to parallelize the job to improve time efficiency.

This was all relevant to me as an NLP engineer, as it was necessary to extract the text from PDFs which I later analyzed. If this sounds interesting to you, shoot me a PM or an email and we can chat about how my team went about this.

I just released the Practical Python Projects book! ([https://practicalpython.yasoob.me](https://practicalpython.yasoob.me/))

You   might or might not remember me from a couple of months back. I posted   about the Practical Python Projects book. It was in the Alpha state and   now I am happy to announce the first version as a release candidate. I   have poured a lot of love into writing this book and would love to  hear  what you guys think. **(A limited 100% off and discount coupons at the  end)**

This is not a  pure beginner  book. The book does assume some background Python  knowledge. You need  to know the basics like methods, functions, classes,  and such. If I use  something that is not typically covered in beginner  Python books, I  will explain it before I use it. There are no tests for  these projects  as they are really small and teach you how to glue  different pieces  together.

Some projects that we will be making

👉   A Twilio bot that keeps you updated with the latest match scores from the FIFA World Cup  
👉   A Facebook Messenger bot the shares latest memes, jokes, and shower-thoughts scraped from Reddit  
👉   An automated invoice generator and deploying it using Flask  
👉   Making automated cinema-preshow by downloading and stitching together related movie trailers using moviepy  
👉   Generating automated article summaries and overlaying them on top of images  
👉   Understanding and decoding JPEG images using vanilla Python  
👉   Creating a GUI application using PyQt for downloading online videos  
👉   Implementing a TUI email client that allows reading emails in the terminal

The full TOC of the book:

""Yasoob’s   book really embraces the idea of building small practical projects. He   takes the reader on a tour of over a dozen projects, reinforcing   research and coding skills along the way. His technical acumen combines   with unbridled enthusiasm to make for a delightful and informative   book.""  
\~ **PyDanny** (Daniel Feldroy)

""Often,   especially as a mentor for budding programmers, I get asked where and   how can one identify projects to begin with. I usually point them to   open-source repositories or a web blog, but I believe now I have this   book as the perfect resource to point to. The book contains a bunch of   carefully crafted projects with step-by-step instructions and code   snippets on how to carry out the execution. Yasoob has put in extra   efforts to include many useful tips throughout the course of the   content. I especially appreciate the pointers at the end of each project   regarding how one could build on top of it, customize, and take it   forward from there.

If you are   fairly new and looking to gain some experience in building end-to-end   Python projects, I would highly recommend using this book as a stepping   stone to further your skills.""

**FAQ**

* **Is this for beginners?**  
This   book assumes knowledge about Python basics. If you have read the   initial chapters of any beginner Python book you should be good. If you   are new to Python, you can start with the amazing Automate The Boring   Stuff With Python book ([https://automatetheboringstuff.com/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)) and then come back here once you are done reading it.
* **What does the purchase include?**  
The purchase includes an EPUB, MOBI, PDF, KP
* **I can't afford the book.**  
I   know we are all going through an economic crisis. If you are in a   situation where you can't buy the book because of financial reasons,   send me an email and I can send you a free copy (hi @ [yasoob.me](https://yasoob.me/)). I don't want money to be a barrier.
* **Is there a print version?**  
Not at this point. If there is enough interest, I might look into getting one out later this year.
* **I didn't receive the book!**  
You  should receive two emails after your purchase. One should be the  receipt and the other one should include the book links. If you don't  receive the second email please send me an email (hi @ yasoob.me).

My background is with java from a start but I've later moved on to c# and c++.

I think my biggest problem with python is the dynamic typing. It just won't make sense in my head. You can't combine 2 variables when printing because the compiler doesn't care to automatically convert them to string where they should be converted.Also recursion is a pain in the butt because return types are optional so reading the code makes for lots of simple mistakes that wouldn't be missed in a stricter language. Also lists can both contain variables and lists and tuples and lists of lists etc. It makes it really annoying to write any compile secure function as I would have to acknowledge every possible combination.Also IDEs aren't as friendly as they are for statically typed languages.It literally makes me nauseous to work with python, and it sucks because I really want to like the language. It's just too chaotic for me.

Does anyone have any advice of how I should interpret the language to give me less headache and nausea? It really does feel like looking at an ugly painting to read code in python.I even took a introductory course in python at university and I still can't get over this feeling.

    from functools import reduce
    
    # some code where we end up with a list of spark dataframes `dfs`
    
    my_dataframe = reduce(DataFrame.union, dfs)

If you've never used spark dataframes, then all you need to know for this example is that a `DataFrame` has a method `union()` that takes a dataframe as an argument, and returns a new dataframe that is the ""union"" of them. Fairly straightforward.

So my first thought when I saw the code above was ""no, that's not right... normally we would write `lambda x, y: x.union(y)`"" for the function in `reduce`. But if you think for a second, it makes sense. For the `DataFrame.union` method, the first argument is `self`, and the second argument is `other`. Calling say `x.union(y)` is really just syntactic sugar for `DataFrame.union(x, y).` So the code my colleague posted is valid, and I would argue actually more pythonic than the lambda I would normally write. 

It seems like this could be used anywhere that you have a homogeneous iterable with a generically typed method like the one above. What are your thoughts? Is this a common technique that you see often?",Python,Interesting use of `self` and `reduce` I saw in the wild,352.0,0.97,

The goal was to get people immediately able to load any file into a reasonable format (pandas DataFrame) for analysis. Our view was that the python eco-system had a ton of really great tools to load various files (csv, tsv, json, parquet, etc), but every time you get to a new file you had to write 100 lines of custom code - no more!

The library provides a single-line load command for most files.

In addition, we attempted to provide some basic analysis tools, as well as a deep learning model (and pipeline) others can plug into.

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid-2021. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step.

\- Enhanced UI (which has more features such as being able to make a survival world without hexedit)

\- Fancy graphics

\- Smooth lighting (or as smooth as a version of Minecraft from 2013 can get)

\- Increased render distance

And much much more!  Not only that, we made our own full server software for hosting your multiplayer games!  We are also working on in-game sounds and a full-on ""world edit"" for MCPI, with things such as space selection with wands, commands, and shape generation. We used Python and tkinter and also make a custom launcher called ""[MCPIL](https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/MCPIL)"" with config options for the mod, as well as a ton of our other projects like [MCPIEdit](https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/mcpiedit) which is basically a MCPI NBT editor, and [MCBES](https://github.com/mcpi-revival/mcbes) (WIP) which translates MCPI multiplayer packets to bedrock. And we’ve saved the best for last! All of our projects are licensed open source, so you can modify, contribute, and redistribute them to your heart’s content! And did we forget to mention that we've made the mod a docker container so you can run MCPI on any Linux OS and system, even x86 PCs?

[appmap](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap-python/) is the AppMap client for Python. In this tutorial, I will show you how to install and configure the `appmap` package to visually map a Django project; AppMap works with Flask also.

[A dependency map of chipy.org](https://preview.redd.it/4nmjk6matuk61.png?width=3360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c48421fcd5e210d8c557a18a7104b604a7ebe3a7)

For this tutorial, I will use the open source application [chipy.org](https://github.com/chicagopython/chipy.org), the website of the Chicago Python User's Group, which is built on Django. At the completion of this tutorial, you'll have interactive visual maps of `chipy.org`. 

Prerequisites:

* Basic familiarity with git, VS Code, Python and Django
* git and Docker installed in your environment (macOS, Windows+WSL, Linux)

## Structure

This tutorial is split into three sections:

* Install Visual Studio Code and the AppMap extension
* Setup and build the `chipy.org` application in a Docker image
* Setup, record and open AppMaps recorded from `chipy.org` tests

# Install Visual Studio Code &amp; the AppMap extension

1. Install the official build of Visual Studio Code - [visit the Visual Studio Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install AppMap for Visual Studio Code from the marketplace - [visit AppMap in the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=appland.appmap)

Alternatively, install and start Visual Studio Code, open the Extensions tab and search for `AppMap` in the extensions list. Install the AppMap extension.

# Build the chipy.org application

The [Chicago Python User Group Website project](https://github.com/chicagopython/chipy.org) comes with detailed setup instructions. The setup steps are described in this guide for your convenience.

## Clone the repository

Start with a local clone of the `chipy.org` repository. In your working folder, clone the repo:

    % git clone https://github.com/chicagopython/chipy.org.git

## Open the chipy.org project in Visual Studio Code

Start Visual Studio Code and open the folder with the `chipy.org` repository. You should see the `README.md` and other files in the root folder.

[chipy.org project in VSCode](https://preview.redd.it/cel2ls5ktuk61.png?width=3360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=161c043616216fff8069491d9e1f9c5f2e612d39)

**Setup chipy.org with Docker**

It is a good practice to setup and run applications before mapping them as it is easier to catch setup and build problems specific to the applications and their dependencies this way.

If you use Windows 10, consult the [installation guide](https://github.com/chicagopython/chipy.org#installation) for setup of the build enviornment, specifically the `make` tool.

To build and run the application:

1. Navigate to the chipy.org folder and run the setup command

&amp;#x200B;

    % make setup_env

2. Start the application with

    % make up

3. Migrate the database

    % make migrate

* optionally, run `make superuser` to create a superuser if you plan to try the superuser support in the app

1. Open the app in the browser. At this point, the application can be accessed on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
2. Run tests

&amp;#x200B;

    % make test

If you have encountered any problems during these steps, please consult the [installation guide](https://github.com/chicagopython/chipy.org#installation) or contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/N9VUap6).

# Setup AppMaps

The `appmap` Python package and the `appmap.yml` configuration file are required for recording AppMaps from tests.

## Configure appmap.yml

The `appmap` package configuration is stored in an `appmap.yml` file in the root directory of Python projects. Create a new file called `appmap.yml` in the root folder of the `chipy.org` folder, and copy/paste these configuration lines in it. The file lists all modules and classes that will be recorded, in this example all objects in the `chipy_org` module:

    name: chipy.org
    
    packages:
    - path: chipy_org

The format of `appmap.yml` is documented in the [appmap-python documentation](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap-python/blob/master/README.md). `appmap.yml` can be fine tuned to include/exclude individual modules, classes and methods.

## Install the appmap package in the Docker image

1. Open shell in the running Docker image

&amp;#x200B;

    % make shell

2. Install the `appmap` Python package

    # pip install appmap

# Record and interact with AppMaps

Before proceeding, please check that:

* the chicopy.org application has been successfully built and running in a Docker container
* the chicopy.org tests ran successfully
* the `appmap` Python package has been successfully installed and configured in the running Docker image
* you have Visual Studio Code running with the chipy.org project folder open

## Run tests, record AppMaps

The AppMap setup is now complete and the application can be recorded when `pytest` tests are run. The recorder will be activated when the env variable `APPMAP` is set to `true`.

1. In the running Docker image shell, run

&amp;#x200B;

    APPMAP=true pytest

The test suite will be run and AppMap files recorded from tests will be created in the `tmp/appmap/pytest` folder of the project.

# Working with AppMaps in Visual Studio Code

Now that you have the AppMaps recorded, let's open them in the Visual Studio Code.

## Open an AppMap file

1. The recorded AppMap files are in the `tmp/appmap/pytest` folder of the `chipy.org` project.
2. Let's open AppMaps that cover the rsvp functionality of the application. Navigate to the `tmp/appmap/pytest` folder in the file explorer and press  `CTRL|COMMAND SHIFT P`
3. Type `rsvp` in the search box and pick any of the .appmap.json files from the results. An AppMap viewer now opens.

Interact with the AppMap diagrams

1. Hide the file explorer by clicking on its icon in the left hand icon bar.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/la477sd2uuk61.png?width=3360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d71f4ef270f006618c3dac4f2a393bdfa7b2555a

2. Explore the `Dependency map`. Click on any component and edge in the map, expand/collapse modules and HTTP endpoints, investigate their details in the left hand navigation bar

3. Switch to the `Trace` view to see how the code and data flows in the application

4. To see how AppMaps can be used to quickly navigate and learn large code bases, [watch this demonstration video](https://www.loom.com/share/327f17cf25de499e9254bde366137306).

5. Additional information about AppMaps and their benefits can be found in the AppMap for Visual Studio Code [online documentation](https://github.com/applandinc/vscode-appland/blob/master/README.md)

6. Explore not only the previously recorded AppMaps but see how code modifications change the way the application runs. Modify the code, re-run the tests with the AppMap recording enabled and observe the changes in the dependencies and flows

7. AppMap your application. Follow the steps outlined in this tutorial and map your application in minutes

8. Tell your friends and colleagues. AppMaps are a fun way to learn how code works but they are also great for sharing your software designs with others

## Share your AppMaps with us!

We would love to see the AppMaps of your application in the Gallery in Discord. [Join us](https://discord.com/invite/N9VUap6) and our diverse community and share your AppMaps there!

TL;DR: I am working on a new version control tool that keeps track of all of your file changes automatically, and makes it easy for you to craft the perfect git history after you’re done working. Would love to hear if you folks find this useful. Site is [https://getsturdy.com/](https://getsturdy.com/)

The main idea right now is to make it easy to create a clear and logical sequence of commits from your work-in-progress code (a.k.a. simple commit history that’s easier to review, lower risk of bugs slipping through).

**This is what I wanna fix**

Coding is not a linear process - we spot and fix things as we notice them. Consider how frustrating it can be to…

* Undo a change you made half an hour ago
* Create easy to review commits when you’ve made many changes to a large file
* Restore the working directory to how it looked 30 seconds ago
* Change the order of your commits

If you’re a git-guru you might be able to do some of these things, but only if you’re planning ahead and making granular commits constantly as you go.

**Enter Sturdy / aka the tool im working on**

It allows you to compose a perfect git history after you’re done working. This means you don’t have to leave your coding flow to create commits while coding.

When you are done coding you get to see all file changes on a timeline. From there you have the power to peek, re-order, split and join them, and easily create a git branch and pull request that’s easy to review.

**Here’s how it works**

The app tracks all changes to all files in your project, independently of git. Using a number of heuristics, it automatically groups changes based on when and what changed.

The smart groups can then be reordered in time, removed, spliced or joined with other groups.

When you’re happy with how the history looks, changes are ‘baked’ into commits on a branch of your choice.

**Would you be interested in trying it out?**

The app is currently in early alpha. I’m looking for people who are interested in trying it out. If this sounds interesting to you, sign up using the form on the site here [https://getsturdy.com](https://getsturdy.com/)

Hi!  


Just sharing my little one-day project.  
I've been doing all kinds of web automation lately and I wanted to do a nice, clean and shareable project. I came up with this idea.  


What does it do?

* Scrap old newspaper front pages from an archive website using `requests`.
* Format the image to optimize it for IG (4:5 ratio) with `cv2`.
* Post it on Instagram through `selenium` running gecko driver.

The whole process was quite easy. Instagram is easier to work with than other major platforms (e.g Twitter).  


Feel free to have a look at my **GitHub repo**: [https://github.com/PabloLec/insta\_newspaper](https://github.com/PabloLec/insta_newspaper)  
Any feedback would be appreciated!  


Have a look at **the bot in action on Instagram**: [https://www.instagram.com/nouvelles\_du\_passe/](https://www.instagram.com/nouvelles_du_passe/)

I've been thinking this for a bit but it just crystalized.

---

A year ago, I put some type hints and used mypy for a couple of projects, but it detected no actual issues, and needed constant babying, so I disabled it.

In the last year, I wrote a [little documentation generator](https://github.com/rec/doks), and it reports the types in signatures if they are there, and suddenly I was putting in types everywhere, just for documentary purposes.

But no typechecker has jumped out at me.  mypy again wasted my time and did not improve my code.

Now I have an application where I got a dictionary from the user and I want to be able to validate if its entries match a function call - but apparently you can't without reams of code.

All I want is this:

    from typing import Union
    
    T = Union[int, float]
    assert T.check(1)
    assert T.check(1.5)
    assert not T.check('a string')
    
But Python has no such thing.  The information is there, but getting it [is hard](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55504010/43839) and that code doesn't seem to be entirely correct either.  (This is what I'll be using though.)

EDIT: that code had an obvious mistake.  I fixed it.  It worked on trivial cases, but threw an exception checking `List[int]` against `[1, 1]`, so I dumped it for [`typeguard`](https://typeguard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#typeguard.check_type).

Python 3.9 [makes it a bit easier](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45957615/check-a-variable-against-union-type-at-runtime-in-python-3-6) but they still haven't just given us that simple `check()` method.

And from reading the documents they did it on purpose.

I think that the documentation for petit-ts is quite OK, but I know that the documentation for petit-type-system still lacks something.
petit-ts also has 100% test coverage, and I'm quite happy about it

Using petit-ts I am now able to easely build custom type converters in python without worrying about how I'am going to integrate everything together. Using the store I can put every type of my app in it as I go and then get the representation as I need them. It also supports the auto addition of generic classes, which can be quite nice.

Most recently, that's been a concerted effort to mess around with Django. However, since I know literally nothing about web development (and very little about large projects where multiple files play together), I wanted a tutorial. I could tell the official tutorial assumed too much, so I eventually found one from about 4 years ago, [A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/beginners-guide/1.11/).

It's cute, and pretty well-written. It's guided me along pretty well as best I can tell. However, it's written for Django 1.xx, while we're now in Django 3.xx. A lot of the code is *almost* correct, but slightly off. Maybe I was just in a good mood, but I've found this incredibly helpful. Perhaps my best skill is debugging code (my own or other's), so having all this code that looks totally correct, because it used to be, yet still needs fixing has forced me to dive into documentation earlier than I normally would. As a result, the tutorial has given me this small foot in the door, and I've been able to learn a lot more about some of the details behind what I'm doing on my own, rather than just proceeding to the next step.

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3lNYk8pPeQ

WhatSoup is a web scraper that exports your entire WhatsApp chat history to plaintext, CSV, or HTML formats. I made it after discovering that WhatsApp limits exports/backups to a maximum of 40k messages, plaintext exports only, and completely skips/deletes messages that have media attached to it (more background is on my [blog](https://eddyharrington.com/2021/02/26/improving-whatsapp-chat-history-exports/) if you care to read). 

It's a pretty standard web scraper and uses Selenium/BeautifulSoup. Where it gets more complex and messy is in the HTML scraping logic due to variations in how WhatsApp renders content - soooo many little nuances between 1on1 chats, group chats, plain text vs rich text (damn you, emojis!), media content, locale differences, etc etc. I had hoped to make other improvements before sharing it but I'm running out of time and have embraced ""perfect is the enemy of good"" especially since the timeframe to backup chats is shrinking due to Facebook's [May 15th deadline](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/).

Afaik, spyder is the only free IDE that comes with a variable explorer (please correct me if I am wrong as I would love to know about any others), which is HUGE. Upon instantiation of most objects, you can immediately see their type, inheritances, attributes, and methods. This is super handy for development and debugging.
2. For data science applications, you can open any array or dataframe and scroll through the entire thing, which is quicker and more informative than typing 'data.head()', 'data\[:10\]', etc. in a new cell.  Admittedly, opening large dataframes/arrays can be demanding on your RAM, but not any more demanding than opening a large csv file. In any case, if you're still in the data-cleaning phase, you probably don't have any scripts running in the background anyway. 
3. There's no need for extra widgets for visualization, which sometimes cause trouble. 
4. You can make cells in Spyder just as you would with Jupyter: just use '#%%' to start a new cell. 
5. The Spyder IDE is relatively low-cost on your CPU and RAM, especially when compared with Vim, Visual Studio, or Jupyter/Google Chrome.

I have been on and off with learning coding for some years now, but this piece of code here is one that I am quite proud of since I actually finished it lol, and it actually gives a sort of quality-of-life improvement. 

Basically a super simple script that authenticates my Youtube account against OAuth (on behalf of the running script), which pulls in all of my account data, and I just query for a specific playlist in my account full of music and, print all the videos and video IDs to a CSV. Then I use YouTube-DL to automatically download videos as mp3s, and just named the files as the video titles.

The code(s) are rather short, here it is:

[The new Macbooks are blazing fast but lack support for most packages.](https://preview.redd.it/iezuecn092k61.jpg?width=4380&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67cd30bd7e9caa0f81299347ad6d912542af6c72)

First I tried installing the only supported arm64 Python version from [python.org](https://python.org) (3.9), but this is quite useless for the moment as trying to install numpy fails with a compilation error. JupyterLab can be installed but fails to run any notebook, causing kernel issues.

*As a side note: it's also possible to run Python, and all major packages trough the Rosetta 2 emulation software. I avoided doing this because you will lose some of the battery and performance gains you get when running on the native architecture.*

## The first step, installing Python using miniforge

We will start by installing Python using Miniforge, **download the arm64 (Apple Silicon) version of the software** on the [miniforge GitHub-page](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/#download)

The arm64 version of Minforge will use Python 3.9 as default, but this is not a problem because you can create a Python 3.8 environment later using the conda create command.

Just follow the instructions as stated on the GitHub page: Navigate the terminal to the location you want to use for installing Python and then run the downloaded shell script. By using the command **:**

`bash` [`Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh`](https://Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh)

## Installing Numpy and Pandas (on Python 3.8)

Once your Python environment is installed you should see the (base) environment in front of your terminal shell. Typing python should show you the default Python version.

Unfortunately, numpy is not supported with this Python version when running arm64. We first need to create a Python 3.8 environment.

This can easily by done by running the conda create command:

`$ conda create -n myenv python=3.8`

After creating the 3.8 environments you can start installing all packages as you usually would. Just activate your environment and you are ready to go. Hope this helps somebody  !

Go to the directory you want to run the web server in. 

For example, go to Desktop. Create a directory,

""mkdir  testServer""

Create a few files : index.html, etc.

Run the following command:
""python3 -m http.server""

It will start a webserver at port 8000 (you can define different port also)

Go to browser and type: ""localhost:8000"" 
Tada !

How it came about:

I decided I wanted to make a bot that will message me on my private Nextcloud server through Nextcloud Talk. I found this curl command that almost worked out of the box. I had the change

...api/v2/chat/... to ...api/v1/chat/... 

This curl works on my Docker instance of Nextcloud running Nextcloud Talk v10.0.6 if anyone wants it.

`curl -d '{""token"": ""&lt;roomid&gt;"", ""message"": ""hi there @&lt;username&gt;}' -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -H ""Accept: application/json"" -H ""OCS-APIRequest: true"" -v -u ""&lt;botusername&gt;:&lt;§%$verylongAppPasswordOfBotUser$%&amp;&gt;"" https://&lt;yourHost.YourUrl&gt;/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v1/chat/&lt;roomid&gt;`

I tried converting this to python. using [curl.trillworks.com](https://curl.trillworks.com) . It spat out this.

`import requests`

`headers = {`

`'Content-Type': 'application/json',`

`'Accept': 'application/json',`

`'OCS-APIRequest': 'true',`

`}`

`data = '{""token"": ""roomid"", ""message"": ""test @userid""}'`

`response =` `requests.post('https://chat.example.com/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v1/chat/roomid', headers=headers, data=data, auth=('bot', 'password'))`

This code  gives me a 404. This is caused by because of the headers. More specifically ""Content-Type': 'application/json"" .  Commenting it out or removing it and it works.

The goal of the project was to learn more about text processing, web dev, and recommender systems. I'm split between calling this a beginner or an intermediate project because for the most part the code is quite simple to anyone familiar with ML engineering, but I've probably been in the game too long to call myself a beginner anymore, lol. 

## Koi No Yokan
I'm currently hosting it [here](http://dwrodri.com), and the repo code is [here](https://gitlab.com/dwrodri/koi-no-yokan). I'll do a more detailed writeup in the future. 

The website has two search features, which the user selects with a radio button:
1. **MyAnimeList Username**: type a username and get recommendations for that user based on their public watchlist
2. **Fulltext**: Perform a tuned search over a selected corpus of shows in the MyAnimeList database. 

On the webdev side, I generate the SERP server-side using the Template class from Python's standard library and serve HTML responses using FastAPI. The HTML + CSS was all written by hand over the course of a few hours, no analytics and a maximum emphasis on KISS.

Recommendations for users are calculated based on a weighted average over all the user-submitted recommendations for each anime in the user's watchlist. For example, a user has watched A and B. I fetch recommendations from A's MyAnimeList page and weight them by the quality rating assigned to A by the user. Then I do the same for B. The result is that recommendations from the user's favorite animes bubble up to the top. So if the user ranked anime A higher than B, recommendations sourced from A's page will be higher than B.

Full-text search is implemented as a TF-IDF search over trigrams (sequences of three characters). I'm using scikit-learn for the vectorization and sparse graph computation. 

Overall, it's been a really fun learning experience taking some concepts which I learned in school and manifesting them into something that I can show other people. I really wish I had invested in skills which allow me to make more things which can be easily shared with non-technical people (e.g. websites, games, UIs, mobile apps) sooner, there's a really primitive sense of joy that comes from sharing this stuff which I previously only got out of offering programming/CS help.",Python,TF-IDF search reviews on MyAnimeList.net and generate recommendations for any MyAnimeList user based on their public watchlist,3.0,0.81,

417,1614383266.0,0.0,lt0eoj,t3,2.0,"Hi there! I decided to work hard on the purity of my code, and one thought does not give me rest.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I have a class called `PreloadedImage`.

An instance of this class contains 2 attributes - `surface`, that is, the image itself, and `mask`, that is, a list of opaque pixels.

And it has several methods like `load()`, `convert()` (converts an image to an internal format to make it appear faster on screen), `resize()` and `create_mask()`.

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to create several instances of this class (1 for each image that will be used in the future).

These preloaded and processed images will then be used elsewhere in the program.

&amp;#x200B;

**That is, I am not planning on changing the attributes of the instances or calling any methods after the instance has been created.**

All the necessary work should be done at the stage of instantiation, as a result I should get an object containing the loaded, processed image of the desired size, as well as its mask.

&amp;#x200B;

And I implemented it this way: [https://trinket.io/python/d6be6cc6c0](https://trinket.io/python/d6be6cc6c0)

`class PreloadedImage:`

`def __init__(self, filename, width, height):`

`self._load(filename)`

`self._convert()`

`self._resize(width, height)`

`self._create_mask()`

&amp;#x200B;

That is, I split the entire process of loading and processing an image into several internal methods, each of which changes the internal state of the `PreloadedImage` instance, and called these methods in the initializer.

**An important caveat:** all these methods must be called in a strictly defined order.

The image cannot be scaled without recalculating the mask, or loaded without calling `convert()` and `create_mask()`.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost everyone to whom I showed this solution said that ""in no case should this be done, it is wrong.""

But the level of reasoning was something like this: ""this is bad practice, it is better to explicitly call methods on an already created instance, for example:

`bg = PreloadedImage('background.jpg')`

`bg.img = bg.convert()`

`bg.img = bg.resize(new_size)`

`bg.mask = bg.create_mask()`

""

And with my implementation it would look like this:

`bg = PreloadedImage('background.jpg', new_size)`

&amp;#x200B;

I sincerely tried to understand why, in this case, verbose explicit calls to all methods are better than calling those same methods when initializing an object.

But I failed.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is the real practical advantage of the ""canonically correct"" implementation, if we put aside the abstract ""everyone does this""?

Explicit is better than implicit, yes.

But is verbose imperative instructions really better than 1 ""highly abstract"" call?",Python,Extracting method's logic into separate protected methods,2.0,1.0,https://external-preview.redd.it/JF00cxuWRmUOLfsY4SXGU_v6YYgV5Lwq73YHrT770s0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4ba95f7d5ef1cfd596b0293733b645d1a39f1ab6

(I think you guys should be able to view the jupyter notebook file. Let me know!)

**Purpose:**

I wanted to analyze the stroke counts (a measure of kanji complexity) versus the frequency of words using that kanji. I was unable to find any data on this, so I did it myself! I thought maybe this would shed some light on how languages can balance possibility for expression and memory limits of human beings (ie: 8 strokes can create more characters than 1, but they are harder to remember).

&amp;#x200B;

In the GitHub are the pngs of the graphs shown. They are pretty neat!

&amp;#x200B;

**Features:**

\* Analysis of Kanji stroke patterns by overall word frequency!

\* Weighs each Kanji by their average use in natural language, then finds the most common stroke counts used in every-day language!

\* Graphs! (Bar and Pie right now).

\* Finds standard deviation and mean of most common stroke counts!

It’s a desktop app that allows you to search in Stack Overflow, search and read documentation, and search public code on GitHub from a single place. The whole app can be controlled just using a keyboard. No need to use your mouse. This way, it’s easier to stay in the flow.

The app works similarly to Spotlight on macOS. You hit a global shortcut and Devbook appears as an overlay over the currently active app. This way you minimalize the needed context switching when looking up information. You almost don't leave your coding editor.

You can think about Devbook as a search engine made just for developers. But no ads, content marketing, SEO, etc.

I thought the community here might find it useful. Currently, we support Python, Flask, Django docs, and adding more with time.

Give it a try and let me know what you think!

**EDIT**

Some folks have been asking us for the pricing. Devbook is free. The plan is to build team features later on and have subscriptions for teams and organizations. If it will be possible, we want to always have a free plan for solo developers.

However, if you really want to support us, I just set up the [Buy Me A Coffee page](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/P8dyVmoAF) for Devbook. You can donate a small amount if you feel comfortable. It will probably make us jump around from the excitement since it would be our first revenue:)

**EDIT 2**

Oh, boy did this blow-up! Every week, we just share Devbook in various subreddits we think might enjoy it. We didn't expect to blow it up that much at all. Thank you all folks for trying Devbook out. It means a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

For the near future Devbook release, we're building an extensions system that will allow you to add search functionality we don't support out of the box. Imagine Google customizable through vscode-like extensions. You can read more [here](https://github.com/DevbookHQ/devbook-extension).

## NLU 1.1.2 Release Notes

We are very happy to announce NLU 1.1.2 has been released with the integration of 30+ models and pipelines Bengali Named Entity Recognition, Hindi Word Embeddings,
and state-of-the-art transformer based OntoNotes models and pipelines from the [incredible Spark NLP 2.7.3 Release](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/releases/tag/2.7.3) in addition to a few bugfixes.  
In addition to that, there is a [new NLU Webinar video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2141&amp;v=hJR9m3NYnwk&amp;feature=youtu.be) showcasing in detail 
how to use NLU to analyze a crypto news dataset to extract keywords unsupervised and predict sentimential/emotional distributions of the dataset and much more!

### [Python's NLU library: 1,000+ models, 200+ Languages, State of the Art Accuracy, 1 Line of code - NLU NYC/DC NLP Meetup Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2141&amp;v=hJR9m3NYnwk&amp;feature=youtu.be)
Using just 1 line of Python code by leveraging the NLU library, which is powered by the award-winning Spark NLP.

This webinar covers, using live coding in real-time,
how to deliver summarization, translation, unsupervised keyword extraction, emotion analysis,
question answering, spell checking, named entity recognition, document classification, and other common NLP tasks. T
his is all done with a single line of code, that works directly on Python strings or pandas data frames.
Since NLU is based on Spark NLP, no code changes are required to scale processing to multi-core or cluster environment - integrating natively with Ray, Dask, or Spark data frames.

The recent releases for Spark NLP and NLU include pre-trained models for over 200 languages and language detection for 375 languages.
This includes 20 languages families; non-Latin alphabets; languages that do not use spaces for word segmentation like
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean; and languages written from right to left like Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, and Hebrew.
We'll also cover some of the algorithms and models that are included. The code notebooks will be freely available online.

[recoverpy](https://i.redd.it/zgb94jra2mj61.gif)

Hi!

Just sharing some casual self-pride, I just pushed my first real project on github named [recoverpy](https://github.com/PabloLec/recoverpy) :)

It's a CUI to recover erased or overwritten data.

&amp;#x200B;

I faced a sad and stupid problem a month ago. I'm usually a backup kind of guy, but I installed a new system and started coding different stuff on it for several days. Then, I had the great idea to overwrite an important script by mistake.

I searched for hours how to get it back, found a lot of ways to recover deleted files but, for an overwritten file, the solution was well hidden.

&amp;#x200B;

That's how I got the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

So, when I found the different commands to get back my file and recover it, I wanted to create a clear UI to do it. Searching for a CUI library, I've stumbled upon [py\_cui](https://github.com/jwlodek/py_cui), based on curses, it has a really easy learning curve. Easy to get it running.

&amp;#x200B;

Making the CUI and the whole program was nice and easy. I've been doing things like this numerous times. Although, documenting it, refactoring it, rethinking it, and making a clean github repo took me a looot more time :)

&amp;#x200B;

I've learned more during this week than in my last 6 months, even if I code \~ every day.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I'm happy to have done it and I recommend to every casual coder to make a clean project. You'll learn a lot!

let me introduce YEDB - the database I developed for our IoT projects. YEDB is free and open-source. Works like etcd, but without RAFT (I'm going to add replication in the future as well). Primary use: configuration files and other reliable data.

So why not etcd?

\- with auto-flush enabled, YEDB flushes all data **immediately**, so it can survive any power loss, except the file system die, which is pretty useful for e.g. embedded computers running inside power boxes without batteries.

\- very simple structure - all keys are files with serialized objects, in case of failure data can be easily repaired/extracted by system administrator (if yaml/json formats used - with any text editor)

\- any key / key group can be automatically validated with assigned JSON Schema

It uses the request library to use the backend of [textnow.com](https://textnow.com)

I was looking at the documentation for an issue of circular import because of type hinting and looked at this document:

[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/#non-goals](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/#non-goals)

Interestingly, it is strongly stated that:

&gt;**Python will remain a dynamically typed language, and the authors have no desire to ever make type hints mandatory, even by convention.**

But also interestingly, if you look at Jetbrains recently released Python developers survey ([https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2020/#PythonFeatures](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2020/#PythonFeatures)) and look at the ""Desired features"" section the #1 desired feature is (roll the drums):

&gt;Static typing, strict type hinting

So my question is twofold:

1. What do you people think about it?
2. Is there a way for Python's developers to listen to the need of the community?

This is if we assume that this survey represents the actual sentiment of the community. But considering that #2 is better performances and #3 better concurrency, I would think it's not too far from the actual python community needs (at least I would love better performances and most of all better concurrency unlimited by the GIL).

Hi! 

Just sharing some casual self-pride, I just pushed my first real project on github named [recoverpy](https://github.com/PabloLec/recoverpy) :) 

That's been quite a ride.

I faced a sad and stupid problem a month ago. I'm usually a backup kind of guy, but I installed a new system and started coding different stuff on it for several days. Then, I had the great idea to overwrite an important script by mistake.

I searched for hours how to get it back, found a lot of ways to recover deleted files but, for an overwritten file, the solution was well hidden. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's how I got the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

So, when I found the different commands to get back my file and recover it, I wanted to create a clear UI to do it. Searching for a CUI library, I've stumbled upon [py\_cui](https://github.com/jwlodek/py_cui), based on curses, it has a really easy learning curve. Easy to get it running. 

&amp;#x200B;

Making the CUI and the whole program was nice and easy. I've been doing things like this numerous times. Although, documenting it, refactoring it, rethinking it, and making a clean github repo took me a looot more time :) 

&amp;#x200B;

I've learned more during this week than in my last 6 months, even if I code \~ every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I'm happy to have done it and I recommend to every casual coder to make a clean project. You'll learn a lot!

Install libmaths on PyPi or from my GitHub: [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/libmaths/) | [GitHub Repo](https://www.github.com/Simple2006/libmaths)

**If you have  GitHub account, please star the repository. I'd greatly appreciate it.**

Three days ago, I decided to create my own Python library as a 14-year old high school student, [libmaths](https://pypi.org/project/libmaths/). I've always used them but something I never understood was how they were made or where they were coming from. I did the research on how to design my library and publish it and immediately started.  I plan on maintaining the library and dealing with any issues or concerns everyday.

An issue I thought  mathematicians faced in programming was the incapability to draw graphs and models in a short period of time within their code.  With some research, I gathered a list of functions I wanted to implement to begin with. I have no calculus experience but I was determined to add a couple calculus functions. I needed a lot of help to understand the math and google came pretty clutch.

**libmaths is an extremely efficient library allowing the user a smooth experience in graphing and modeling functions. From linear functions all the way to sextic functions and much more, libmaths has it all.**

In the GitHub repository, examples for every single function are provided as well as the file itself if you would like to play around with the values or change code yourself.

If there's one thing I learned from this experience, it's that math and computer science put together can be an amazing tool and there's no limit to how much you can learn with the internet.

To anyone trying to pursue coding, there's plenty of resources on the internet and considering we are already in the r/Python subreddit, you can also put math to use in your code!

548,1614040964.0,0.0,lpt2qm,t3,0.0," With its near perfection beauty, Python is named as one of the top-picked programming languages of most universities and industries. What makes it irresistible is it’s broad applications to other fields and limitless possibilities to create amazing things out of scratch.

According to TechRepublic, Python developer is one of the “10 Most In-Demand Tech Jobs of 2019”. This is due to the rise of AI and Machine Learning technologies in the global market. As of February 23, 2019, the average salary for a  Python developer is $123,201 per year in the United States, making it one of the most popular and lucrative careers today.

Indeed, there are many reasons why you should learn Python. And to understand deeper its scope and benefits, here are the **Top 7 uses of Python**.

Python can be used on the following:

1. Multiple Programming Paradigms  
2. Web Testing  
3. Data Extraction  
4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science Researches  
5. Web Application and Internet Development  
6. Database Easy Access, Interface Customization, and Quick System Integration  
7. Cybersecurity

 1. Multiple Programming Paradigms

Python has the upper hand when it comes to supporting a number of programming paradigms like object-oriented programming, functional programming, empirical programming, and structured programming. Python can be used to develop both large and small applications. You can use it to engineer and produce various applications such as; game, android, multi-software and web applications. Thanks to it’s dynamic and strongly typed nature that helps in earlier error detections.

Moreover, Python has built-in functions to test variable types and proper usage. It also has automatic memory management for managing and dealing with several dynamic storage management which is useful for sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching.

##### 2. Web Testing

Python is the best choice for programmers in testing website applications and other related web interfaces before launching it on live sites to avoid bugs and errors. It has a built-in unit test framework called “PyUnit” that assure your code works as expected. Aside from test automation, Python unittest supports setup sharing and code tests shutdown, test aggregation, test collections, and test reporting. Its impressive string manipulation and easy shell access make it an extremely beneficial language for smooth automating repetitive tasks.

##### 3. Data Extraction

Another beautiful feature of Python is Data Extraction or Web Scraping. It is a process to retrieve and organize data from different sources on the web and turn them into valuable ones. Python has many web scraping tools (e.g., Selenium, urllib2) and frameworks (e.g., Scrappy) that can efficiently retrieve online data or webpage content, not to mention its very robust standard library (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Requests) that can provide highly functional tools suited to do varied tasks aside from data extraction. Also, web scrapers are convenient for machine learning projects, data retrieval, SEO ranking, marketing and sales campaigns, e-commerce data collection, etc.

##### 4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science

Nowadays, most data scientists and software engineers use Python to conduct further studies, and researches on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science. It can be used across other domains and technologies, which is a huge advantage. It’s not surprising for it is an interpreted language; users can directly run the program without compiling data into machine language before execution. This makes Python codes comprehensive and easy to be interpreted by an emulator or a virtual machine.

Besides, it’s very explicit that it beats other OOP languages for the least code programming language. According to Cuelogic, a company that develops software globally to help startups companies, “Python has Prebuilt Libraries like Numpy for scientific computation, Scipy for advanced computing and Pybrain for machine learning (Python Machine Learning) making it one of the best languages For AI and Data Science.”

### So, how can you modernize tkinter?

## There are two options:
- Using a [Style](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/styles.html) to use built-in or third-party themes and set the appearance of the widgets, or
- Using the [ttkthemes](https://github.com/TkinterEP/ttkthemes) package, which contains many different themes, and makes them much easier to use

## Let's look at the first option first:

### Ttk has built-in themes that are available on all os, but there are also platform specific themes.

#### Built in themes:
On all platform: `alt`, `clam`, `classic`, `default`\
Mac: `aqua`\
Windows: `vista`, `winnative`, `xpnative`

#### If you just want to use one of these:

    # Create a style
    style = ttk.Style(root)
    
    # Set the theme with the theme_use method
    style.theme_use('the name of the theme you want to use')

### There are also third-party themes, a list of which can be found [here](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/List+of+ttk+Themes):
#### Themes that use a single tcl file:
- [Azure](https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme)
- [Breeze](https://github.com/MaxPerl/ttk-Breeze)
- [Itft1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/daft/files/themes/Themes%20for%20DaFT%201.4/)
- [Sriv](https://sourceforge.net/p/ballroomdj/code/ci/default/tree/code/themes/sriv.tcl)
- [Waldorf](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/waldorf+ttk+theme)
- and also the themes of [ttkthemes](https://github.com/TkinterEP/ttkthemes)

#### If you want to use a single tcl file:

    # Create a style
    style = ttk.Style(root)
    
    # Import the tcl file with the tk.call method
    root.tk.call('source', 'the path to a tcl theme file')
    
    # Set the theme with the theme_use method
    style.theme_use('the name of the imported theme')

### Use a theme package, that contains several different themes (e.g. [awthemes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl-awthemes/):

    # Create a style
    style = ttk.Style(root)
    
    # Adding the package's directory to Tcl's auto_path
    root.tk.call('lappend', 'auto_path', 'path to the package folder')
    
    # Import the theme from the package
    root.tk.call('package', 'require', 'the name of a theme from the package')
    
    # Set the theme with the theme_use method
    style.theme_use('the name of the theme you want to use')

## Using the ttkthemes package:
#### The ttkthemes package gives you more than 30 different themes, and you can even modify them, if you don't like the way they look
#### The documentation can be found [here](https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
#### Installing the package is very easy via pip:

    pip install ttkthemes

### Usage

    # You have to use Ttk (Themed Tk) widgets, because the simple Tkinter widgets don't support the use of themes
    from tkinter import ttk

    # From the ttkthemes package import the ThemedTk widget
    from ttkthemes import ThemedTk

    # Creating a window, with theme
    root = ThemedTk(theme='adapta')

    # Get the available themes
    print(root.get_themes())

    # Creating a themed button
    button = ttk.Button(root, text=""Quit"", command=root.destroy)
    button.pack(pady=20)

It is about time to share a project I've been working on for some time now. It may interest fellow Python functional programmers. It is an IO monad with support for dependency injection, failure management, asynchronous programming and resource management.

*Raffiot* is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/raffiot/). The [documentation is here](https://chrilves.github.io/raffiot.py/index.html), the [API there](https://chrilves.github.io/raffiot.py/api/index.html) and the [source code is here](https://github.com/chrilves/raffiot.py).

Here is a tiny example of how to concurrent tasks (the [complete example can be found here](https://github.com/chrilves/raffiot.py/blob/main/demos/raffiot_demo.py)):

    def prog(color, name, i) -&gt; IO[None, None, None]:
        """"""
        Print in `color` every number from `i` to 1.
        """"""
        if i &gt; 0:
            return io.defer(print, f""{color}From prog {name}: {i}{reset}"").then(
                io.yield_(), io.defer_io(prog, color, name, i - 1)
            )
        else:
            return io.pure(0)
    
    
    # The main IO
    main: IO[None, None, None] = (
        io.parallel(
            prog(bred, ""A"", 100000),
            prog(bgreen, ""B"", 100000),
            prog(byellow, ""C"", 100000),

        .then(io.defer(print, ""finished""))
    )

Hi there!

I'm happy to announce version 1.14 of [reader](https://github.com/lemon24/reader), a Python Atom / RSS feed reader library.

**reader** takes care of the core functionality required to build a feed reader, allowing you to focus on what makes **yours** different.

What's new:

* JSON Feed support
* default timeouts for HTTP feeds
* method for getting per-feed update status as feeds get updated
* *reader* now recognizes the SQLite databases it creates, and will not initialize in a non-empty database belonging to another application
* better support for custom feed formats
* `reader update` output improvements: progress bar, success/failure summary, colors!
* improved feed detection heuristic in the web app

https://i.redd.it/j05wgzgmo1j61.gif

Why make your own feed reader? So you can:

* have full control over your data
* control what features it has or doesn’t have
* decide how much you pay for it
* make sure it doesn’t get closed while you’re still using it
* really, it’s easier than you think

558,1614031845.0,0.0,lpovof,t3,49.0,"I needed a powerfull tool for dict validation for work purpose, so I did that:

```
def type_validator(*arg_types, **kwargs_types):
    def decorator(func):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            def rec_check(value, target):
                if type(value) == target or target is False:
                    return True
                elif type(target) == tuple != type(value):
                    return target == () or target == (False,) or type(value) in target
                elif type(value) == type(target) and type(value) in (list, tuple, set):
                    return all(rec_check(v, target[0]) for v in value)
                elif type(value) == type(target) == dict:
                    return (len(value) &lt;= len(target)
                            and all(k in value for k, v in target.items() if v and (type(v) != tuple or all(v)))
                            and all(rec_check(v, target[k]) for k, v in value.items()))
                else:
                    return False

            if len(args) &lt; len(arg_types):
                raise TypeError(f'Missing {len(arg_types) - len(args)} required positional argument for type validation')
            for kwargs_types_key in kwargs_types:
                if kwargs_types_key not in kwargs:
                    raise KeyError(f'Missing required argument {kwargs_types_key} for type validation')
            for i, (arg, arg_type) in enumerate(zip(args, arg_types)):
                if not rec_check(arg, arg_type):
                    raise TypeError(f'Incorrect type validation for argument in position {i + 1} of type {type(arg)}')
            for kwarg_key, kwarg_value in kwargs.items():
                if kwarg_key in kwargs_types and not rec_check(kwarg_value, kwargs_types[kwarg_key]):
                    raise TypeError(f'Incorrect type validation for argument {kwarg_key} of type {type(kwarg_value)}')
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return inner
    return decorator
```

So what does it does ?

It's basically a compact, portable and library independant decorator for any type validation possible. Usage is as easy as possible :
```
@type_validator(int, int)
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(2, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5

add('foo', 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; TypeError: Incorrect type validation for argument in position 1 of type &lt;class 'str'&gt;
```

Main purpose was for complex Python types validation, so ofc I can do that :
```
dict_type = {
    'foo': int,
    'bar': (str, type(None)),   # Value can be str or NoneType
    'test': {
        'foo': [()],           # All elements of list can be any type
        'bar': (int, False)     # Optional key of type int
    }
}

@type_validator(dict_type)
def test(dict_value):
    return 'Ok'

test({
    'foo': 0,
    'bar': None,
    'test': {
        'foo': [0, 'test'],
        'bar': 5
    }
})
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok

test({})
&gt;&gt;&gt; TypeError: Incorrect type validation for argument in position 1 of type &lt;class 'dict'&gt;
```

And can handle args and kwargs
```
@type_validator(int, b=int)
def test(a, b=None):
    return 'Ok'

test(2, b=3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok
```

Short options possibilities :
```
int                       # Value have to be int
(int, type(None))         # Value can be int or NoneType
(,)                       # Value can be any type
[int]                     # list of int
{int}                     # set of int
(int,)                    # tuple of int
{
    'foo': int,           # Mandatory key of type int
    'bar': False,         # Optional key of any type
    'test': (int, False)  # Optional key of type int 
}
```

So I'm pretty happy with how it goes so far, but it's nearly unreadable because of how compact I wanted the tool to be. Still checking to improve it, if you have any advice for me, I'm interested o/

[yt-videos-list](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt-videos-list/tree/main/python) only has a single dependency on Selenium (well, technically 2, since `selenium` depends on `urllib3`), and only requires 3 lines of code after installing to get the video info:

    # install the package
    pip install -U yt-videos-list    # pip3 if you're on macOS
    
    
    # enter python interpreter
    python                           # python3 if you're on macOS
    
    
    # import and run program 🤓
    from yt_videos_list import ListCreator
    lc = ListCreator(driver='firefox', scroll_pause_time=1.2)
    lc.create_list_for(url = 'https://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy')

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: You can also use different drivers! Currently supported drivers:

    driver='firefox'
    driver='opera'
    driver='safari'    # only on macOS
    driver='chrome'
    driver='brave'
    driver='edge'      # only on Windows

ALSO NOTE: Depending on how you've set up your machine, you might also need to run in administrator mode on Windows (`Windows` \+ `X` \+ `A`) or grant write access to `/usr/local/bin/` (`sudo chown $USER /usr/local/bin/`). This is needed usually only on the first run since the selenium binaries need to be installed into your PATH location, otherwise the program won't be able to access the Selenium driver ([see this for more details](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt-videos-list/blob/main/docs/dependencies.json))!

# More details:

    # default arguments for ListCreator object:
    
    ListCreator(

      reverse_chronological=True,
      headless=False,
      scroll_pause_time=0.8,
      driver='firefox'
      )

There are a number of optional arguments you can specify during the instantiation of the ListCreator object. The preceding arguments are run by default, but in case you want more flexibility, you can specify the:

* `driver` argument:
   * `driver='firefox'`
   * `driver='opera'`
   * `driver='safari'`
   * `driver='chrome'`
   * `driver='brave'`
   * `driver='edge'`

I learned Python basics during the quarantine in April-May and made this project somewhere in July, but only now did I find the time to fully comment it, hence the delay! It's intended to work with text using styling from .*docx* files. Parsing was especially a hard thing to crack, because, as you will see, in the sort of text that is being processed the same delimiter might be used to actually separate different parts of data or simply be a part of one big variable to be extracted and stored. Some of this code might not be as efficient and/or well thought-out (the `complex_parse_into_signals` is especially scary), but otherwise I think it's rather tidy (although already as I was commenting it, I saw plenty room for improvement). And it works as intended (at least for now :)).

The code requires [python-docx](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/) package, and I'm not sure if it's a standard library, but I also use the `msvcrt` library.

I just released version 3.0.1 of [ScreenPy](https://github.com/perrygoy/screenpy), which is a tool i've been working on for about four years now and using professionally for about one. I created this module after seeing a talk by [Antony Marcano at SeleniumConf UK 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f8tdZBvAbI), but seeing no modules for Screenplay Pattern in Python. It's a tool that gives a solid base for Screenplay Pattern test automation suites. 

Screenplay Pattern is a way to organize your test code that focuses on the journey your users take through your application. It represents your users as Actors, performing Actions and asking Questions. 

The structure focuses on composition over inheritance, to improve maintainability. The other (more popular) architecture pattern for automated tests, called [Page Object Model](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/guidelines_and_recommendations/page_object_models/), runs into some problems that Screenplay Pattern was designed to avoid. These problems are caused by violations of the S (Single-Responsibility Principle) and O (Open/Closed Principle) of the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) object-oriented design principles.

Anyway, i can easily type forever about this stuff 'cause i geek out about it, but i'm hoping this will inspire some of you to try it out! The module has gotten a little bit of attention through—i guess—curious internet searchers. I thought it was finally polished enough to actually show off.

For additional context, I'm working in a development position that is strongly tied to a specific enterprise software vendor. I get to work with Python on most projects, but I also do a lot of other stuff (some JS and Groovy, also integration development inside of a proprietary integration platform). The job is OK in most regards, but most of the underlying tech that I get to work with is simply overpriced garbage and I feel like I'm locking myself inside of this vendor's ecosystem and missing out on working with some more interesting and modern technology.

So, I'd like to switch to a Python/Django role where I'd be vendor-free and where I would develop more generally applicable development skills. I've been working in tech for about 5 years in various positions, and in this development/consultant role for about 2 years. It wouldn't make much sense for me to go back to being a junior Python developer, and I'm certain my knowledge of Python itself is above junior level. So, since I'm aiming for intermediate-level roles, I'd like to know how to develop my knowledge and skills in order to make this a smooth transition.

I started building a Django web app with my friend who's a frontend developer, we're doing it as a learning project so that we could both learn technologies we're interested in. I'm using it to learn things like DRF, Docker, Celery, as they're commonly used with Django. Also, I'm planning to develop a simple Python package for working with my countries' Personal Identity Numbers -- nothing complex really, just to push myself to learn how to publish a package and I guess it also looks nice on my resume.

As an aside: it's actually quite annoying from a UX perspective as there's nothing on the download page to say it's incompatible. And the way it fails is to just refuse to open with no error message. I spent quite a while - including several reboots, several reinstalls of Kite and even a fresh install of pycharm - trying to work out whether it was running in the background, or what was causing it to crash before I found a github issue which explains it's just broken for M1.

As a backend ML engineer I've always been intimidated by building UIs and web stuff. I found it really easy to generate the UI with the [streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io) Python library. Streamlit also acts as a wrapper for the Altair charting library. This means I was able to generate a Javascript/HTML front end and interactive charts with only Python. The entire web app is just one Python file.

I'm pulling data from several sources, all linked at the bottom of the page. There is also more explanation on how the forecast model works. This project relies heavily on the Pandas library.

The project has 4 parts:

1. Covid-19 Vaccination and Immunity Tracker
2. Forecasts of hospitalizations, deaths, etc
3. Interactive correlation explorer. Find out how predictive cases or other variables are of hospitalizations.
4. ARIMA forecasts of all variables. This was done with the [sktime.org](https://sktime.org) package.

Thought this might be of use. Works best with clear audio.

&amp;#x200B;

What is it?

\* Uses GoogleTranslate to create subtitle files for imported audio. If video, converts the video to .wav and does the same thing. Has potential to translate between languages.

Limitations:

\* Because I do not have a ""premium"" Google account (or whatever it is called for the paid API), I do not have access to all of the features. The biggest of these is timestamps. 

Besides the payment, there are some barriers implicit to using automated translation. The biggest one is that translation engines as of now are not the best when it comes to more muddied audio. 

For instance, this translation works very well with crisp clips of one or two people speaking at turns, but loses power as background voices / noises come into play. This would best be used 

for something like getting translations of audiobooks, or podcasts (anything with very clear audio).

&amp;#x200B;

Features:

\* Translates audio clips!

\* Translates video clips!

\* Creates subtitle files for each clip!

\* Allows for translation from a source lang to a target lang! (Look at the files w/in here)

The layout can be improved. One part of this is that Twitter is a bit annoying with the Unicode block characters that are used for the bars: they are not all displayed in the same width, so sometimes the bars are not exactly equal width. Maybe I could correct for this by figuring out the display widths of all characters exactly and seeing if there are Unicode spaces with specific widths that could be used to correct things. Anybody have experience with this?

Another part is that the lines are still too wide for mobile displays.

A few passionate folks from the Chronic Coder community and I are running a free, professionally guided program called Chronic Coder Academy. It's for people who are into Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Frontend Development, or UX Design and are itching to put their skills to use.

When I started programming, my growth was essentially stagnant until I took on a project of my own (away from books/tutorials) and I saw my progress skyrocket. That same message is one we consistently hear from beginners and professionals alike. However, it's difficult to work towards something you care about and keep yourself accountable throughout. With that, the goal of the CCA is to build and ship a product as a team with the intention of learning while applying your knowledge.

It's a 10 week part-time fellowship where groups of passionate people with diverse skill sets come together to build something people can and want to use. We've had an amazing time working with people from over 10 countries (and 9 timezones) so far. If you're interested in solving interesting problems with great people, we would love to hear from you or anyone you know who might be interested!

We're officially **accepting our 3rd cohort of applicants today**! Sign-ups end on the 26th of February 2021.

Learn more and sign up here: [https://www.notion.so/Chronic-Coder-Academy-Season-3-dbd4a42c517a4902b345a7fb7287cedf](https://www.notion.so/Chronic-Coder-Academy-Season-3-dbd4a42c517a4902b345a7fb7287cedf) (Check out the **Program Details** and **Application Criteria/FAQ**)

[https://github.com/josvromans/python\_file\_operations](https://github.com/josvromans/python_file_operations)  
The image operations depend on Pillow (Python Imaging Library).  
They work well for jpeg files, I also tried most of them with png. Some things might not work for some other formats, but hopefully you can make it work with a small adjustment..  
The Image tags are very specific (exif info for jpeg).  
The video operations work with ffmpeg.  
Now I made them also available in Nautilus, the filesystem that I use (default on Ubuntu): selecting files or an entire directory, then right click scripts --&gt; your\_custom\_action. This works really well, I regret that I did not do it earlier. It is a huge time saver for me.   
I provided a strategy how you can make ANY (that is literally anything you can code in Python) file operation available in the file system:  
[https://github.com/josvromans/nautilus\_python](https://github.com/josvromans/nautilus_python)  


So these two repositories basically can use each others functionality.

I am aware of several issues (and the fact that people are going to mention sys.path :D), but since my goal was to just share what I have, I do just that (making it perfect is going to cost me a bit too much time). Suggestions (even better: fixes) are welcome!

One thing to mention: for jpeg operations, there is quality loss. I think I have to put quality=100 back in place, or have a look at the subsampling. 

This is entirely written for my own use case, and is untested for yours. So a few general advices:

the safest way is to apply a single actions on the same image types (for some general actions it does not matter, but for some it is not implemented to work for every format). There are some useful commands in the code. For example: the make\_video command will only work if all files in the selected directory have the same dimensions. There will be no feedback when it fails (ffmpeg is run as a subprocess).  
Before trying it on an entire directory, you might want to check if it works for a single file of your format.

Nowhere are  image deleted. There is a method in 'helpers' that will put the orginal files in a subfolder, so that one can be called after an operation. And if you are really sure, you could os.unlink.. I left this out on purpose.

This is proven to be very useful for me, I hope it helps some of you.",Python,"python_file_operations: a collection of file operation with a focus on image operations, all can be made available in Nautilus / GNOME files, so you can select a directory and apply any python method on all of the selected files.",4.0,0.71,

**THE SITUATION**

My son came into the world last month and, as first time parents, we've had a hard time handling his hectic feeding schedule. He would burst into screams, and we'd scramble to get a bottle prepared/warmed. However there wasn't a very good way to know how much milk to warm (once you heat it, it has to be either consumed or discarded). And since a bottle takes 5+ minutes to heat up, we'd spend that time fumbling to soothe him until it was ready. After one-to-two weeks of this, I decided to do something about it.

That's why I created a Python project to take out the guesswork! From the beginning, we were logging all of his feeds because we wanted to make sure he was eating enough (and wasn't eating too much). We use a shared Google Keep note because that's the easiest/quickest way to do it on our phones. And since we'd already gotten into the habit of logging data, I figured 'why not use it to predict when the next bottle will be demanded?'

**WHAT IT DOES**

The program scrapes all of the content from the Google Keep note and then uses it to estimate the next feed. This estimation includes not only the time, but also the quantity of milk to prepare. It's based on the patterns exhibited over the prior three days, and takes into account both his bottle feeds and his direct breastfeeds. My original goal was to create a legitimate predictive model of his feed patterns, but it quickly became apparent that an explicit model wouldn't be the best strategy (largely due to the irregularity of the feed time data points).

Once it has crunched the data, the program emails both of us with the outputs. Each email contains two distinct sections: the estimates and the summary. The estimates are the metrics related to the next anticipated bottle (feed time and milk quantity) and they've been pretty accurate so far. The summary includes things like average total daily intake / average feed size / average time between feeds / etc. It's just something I threw in to give us some trending insight, but it's turned out to be immensely helpful -- particularly when answering questions at the pediatrician's office.

**ADMIN/SETUP**

The program is 100% Python, but it does include some non-standard libraries: gkeepapi and pandas. Unfortunately, Google doesn't support API access for Google Keep (why not??) and we weren't willing to change the way we log data. But luckily [gkeepapi](https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi) exists, and that has proven to work great. The downside is that frequently accessing the Keep note through unofficial means caused Google to regularly prompt me to verify my account activity, which got *very* old *very* quickly. To mitigate that, I added a feature in the program to only check the note when there's likely to be new information there. Since adding that, Google has stopped bugging me about it.

Using Launchd, I've scheduled the program to run every ten minutes. It can obviously be run manually as well, but it can be run as often as desired. Even if it's run very frequently, it won't access the Keep note or send an email unless there's likely to be new data to consider.

One goal for this project was that the Google Keep note wouldn't have to change formats from what we'd been doing from the start (we wanted to keep formatting the note lines in the way that was easiest/most intuitive for us). As a result, the format which will allow the program to interpret dates/times/quantities is somewhat rigid. Anyone who uses the program will need to emulate our log style or rewrite the code which extracts data. Another goal for the project was that I'd get some pandas practice in. I admit that pandas was likely overkill for this application, but I wanted to get some experience using it and this project has definitely helped me with the basics.

**NOTES**

The mins/maxes for the time between feeds and the quantities of milk are based on standards for the baby's age (stored in age\_info.txt). My son has been fairly consistent/normal with his feeds, so the generally accepted mins/maxes work just fine. But if -- for example -- a baby wanted to eat every hour, the minimum milk quantity per feed would probably be too much.

Since I made this project for my own use and don't really expect other people to use it, there are some hardcoded values. Nothing major -- just people's names for the email, and the note ID for accessing the Google Keep note.

The task is: **Given two character strings, find the longest string of characters present anywhere in both strings.**

I should point out that there is a different, well known, task which is to find the longest common sub**sequence** between two strings.

 A sub\*\*sequence\*\* if a string is any characters from the string, in the  order that they appear in the string, \*but intervening characters can be  skipped\*.   
 There is no such skipping allowed in a sub\*\*string\*\*

Hello,

I wanted to share the first project I have programmed. It is a 1-played, automated ""Black Jack"" game, also known as ""21."" It includes automatic handling for Aces being the value 1 or 11. It also includes the three special instances in black jack being insurance, splitting hands, and doubling down. 

This is all 100% original code, and I did not reference any other coded versions of black jack while creating it. However, I was inspired to build it after reading ""The Self Taught Programmer,"" and completing his exercise creating the card game ""War.""

My intention was to practice different coding concepts I have learned in Python, and also other processes such as using GitHub, project workflow, organization, etc.

I would greatly appreciate constructive criticism and recommendations. And no, the ""front end"" of this program is not meant to look very pretty, it was not my focus... And it still has some bugs, which I am continuing to work out.

First, I know that what I want to do can (almost easily) be done with `numpy`, `numpy.linalg` and a bit of `scipy`. However, I am missing a few abstractions on top, so bear with me for a second.

# Background / Problem

I working with datasets that contain large numbers of geometries. Not only 2D stuff which could be handled by e.g. `shapely`, but also 3D and 4D elements. While analyzing this data, I have to perform a ton of transformations and - admittedly - simple linear algebra operations. Getting them exactly right with `numpy` the first time is ... well, I need lots of coffee for this kind of task, even after years of practice. Debugging broadcasting and slicing notations can also badly distract from the actual task at hand. Multiple times actually I ended up writing stupid classed like `Vector2D` and `VectorArray2D` or `Plane3D` and `PlaneArray3D` etc. I guess you understand what they are doing. They are usually thought-through wrappers around relevant parts of `numpy` and `numpy.linalg` (with tons of custom ""dunder""-methods) where `cupy` can be used as a drop-in-replacement for running this stuff on GPUs as far as possible. My operations happen ""at scale"", i.e. I am usually talking about at least millions of geometries per operation. 

# Question

Recently, I even found myself implementing a `MatrixArray` class - a thing that can hold an ""array"" of either 2x2 or 3x3 matrices. I can use it to transform both an ""array of vectors"" of similar length OR to transform a single vector into a new array of vectors (via my own implementation of `__matmul__`). This is when I began to think that this is a little too crazy. Why has not anybody else done something like this before?

# My Findings (so far)

All of the described tasks are typically performed in 3D engines, e.g. for games. As far as I can tell, I have not found an engine accessible by Python that simply exposes its geometry handling - so I do not have to work with the entire engine and its rendering stack. Also, above a certain quantity of data, 3D engines do not behave too well ;)

What I have found so far are a couple of promising libraries in terms of API and handling. However, those would require extensive development for my needs, e.g. [vectormath](https://github.com/seequent/vectormath) (subclassing and extending `numpy.ndarray`) or [vectors](https://github.com/allelos/vectors) (more or less pure Python). There are also unmaintained and mostly undocumented packages with similar ideas, e.g. [LinearAlgebra](https://pypi.org/project/LinearAlgebra). Fragments of my own limited solutions are published [here](https://github.com/pleiszenburg/bewegung/tree/develop/src/bewegung/core/vector) as a small piece of infrastructure in a video rendering package.

For your XBee needs, I invite the community to checkout the [unofficial fork of xbee library](https://github.com/duysqubix/xbee-python-unofficial).

Why Another Repo?

The unofficial repository was spawned due to four main reasons that lacked in the official repository.

1. Outdated releases and pypi packages. Latest release and current master branch are separated by over 250 commits.
2. Lack of activity by moderators regarding issues and open PR's. Some PR's date back to late 2019 with no activity, despite community reaching out. This causes a loss of interest in the project and fewer contributors.
3. Breaking the barrier of bureaucracy and allowing the continued effort of this library to be extended by the direct help of the community.
4. See 1 &amp; 2.

`ruptures v1.1.3` is just out !

`ruptures` performs off-line change point detection. It is supported by [Centre Borelli](http://www.centreborelli.fr/) and backed up by state-of-the-art research in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Many real life industrial problems can be represented as a change point detection task. Possible applications field is just infinite (oil&amp;gas, medical, finance, medical, music, text, ...). That is why `ruptures` already has a huge success (1M+ downloads) ! We keep improving the library :

* We added algos implemented in C to improve execution time by a factor 500x ! We can now support fairly large amount of data in a reasonable amount of time !
* We are adding examples taken from specific industries to illustrate what can be achieved in terms of business logic. We started with an example on how to segment music soundtrack using `ruptures`. More to come (NLP, Finance, ...). You can run the examples by yourself in a remote executable environment using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/deepcharles/ruptures/master) !

The documentation : [here](https://centre-borelli.github.io/ruptures-docs/)

The Github repository : [here](https://github.com/deepcharles/ruptures)

`ruptures` has very robust devops processes : automatic testing, automatic documentation build, automatic package build (PEP517/518).

Available on Pypi and Conda for Python 3.x (with x in {6, 7, 8, 9}), on Linux, Windows and MacOS, and in 32 or 64 bits !

So far the app features a password generator, a password testes and the instruction. I haven't mastered style standard, but I will very soon. So, for now, I'd like to get some tips, advices, hints and suggestions, as I am a begginer in Python.

I'm using Python mainly to write simple CLI utilities for my job (automation, web scraping, etc.).

These utilities write on the standard output by using `print` statements (e.g. when parsing my retail banking website, I want my utility to print the amount for the next installment of my mortgage). I'm ok with this. 

Now, I'm looking for some opinions around logging when developing CLI scripts. INFO, DEBUG, ERROR I have no issues with the levels. Specifically
- shall I always include one or more options to force a specific log level (e.g.` -v` for `verbose`)?
- is it common to have an external configuration file for logging or shall I manage everything from the source code?
- is it accepted to log on the standard output? I don't like the fact that log lines and normal output lines are ""mixed"" (different format, print statements are pure text, log lines contain date, time, etc. )

Any indication is appreciated? Even pointing me towards some very famous CLI programs and their ""solution"".",Python,Opinions on best way to manage logging in Python CLI utilities,4.0,0.83,

We all know how it is to go for a GUI and create or delete repositories, set themes, see all the repo names, and some more features. Some people also like to use the VSCode's or Atom's integrate with GitHub.

Some might even use the evergreen terminal for GitHub CLI.

But here I would like to introduce 'gnv' the tool i made that would use the terminal to get commands and open new automation, just sit back and relax while the program helps u out.

gnv uses selenium and click modules of python as dependencies.

Now some might ask why am I not using GitHub's API? The answer is when the automation starts the API is indirectly loaded and is at a good pace that loading locally

Setting up a chrome driver is not difficult to work I believe, just download, extract, place in a suitable directory, and export its path.

So what are u waiting for give my module a try.

* Selection of dataframes &amp; viewing the data within them after selection
* Uploading of additional dataframes from an excel file
* Viewing python code snippets &amp; resulting data from a merge or stack

D-Tale is available on both pypi &amp; conda:

* `pip install dtale`
* `conda install dtale -c conda-forge`

In my previous projects, I was using `psaw` to search for comments and submissions and found that the request completion times became quite slow when querying for 200,000 or more comments or submissions. I decided to try putting together a more optimized wrapper that would incorporate multithreading to improve the performance. After doing some benchmarking, I found that my package `pmaw` was 1.79x faster than `psaw` when retrieving 400k posts.

However, up until today, there was another problem left unsolved. For another project I was working on, I extracted 9 million comments from Pushshift and narrowly avoided an out of memory error from Python. In the latest release, I added support for ""memory safety"" which periodically caches responses to ensure that memory usage stays low. Enabling memory safety reduced the maximum memory and memory use by 58.2% and 90.97%, respectively. 

If you want to see how I implemented multithreading, rate-limiting, and caching, my code is available [here](https://github.com/mattpodolak/pmaw).

858,1613245760.0,0.0,liz594,t3,4.0,"Hey guys! So I had this idea last year (Although I'm sure it already exists in some form) that I wanted to select a random episode from an anime series that I've already seen. I have a few series that I like to re-watch at times, but I don't want to start at episode 1 each time. The episode itself is selected using the animixplay website, and the code pulls from the Jikan API. Since it pulls from the Jikan API, I built in a few other features such as displaying the top upcoming anime, and being able to run a reddit/youtube search on those animes as well discovering series by genre or the date that they were released. and the This turned into a little Covid lockdown project and the first project that I've seen through from start to finish on my own since graduating from Uni. It currently only runs on Windows and Linux. It's more or less something that I made for fun and I know it could be cleaned up visually, and the code itself is messy in some areas, but it's my little Covid lovechild :)

I finally got fed up with the inefficiency of making and managing so many versions of my resume. Python has long interested me and I first learned to use it for data cleaning and analysis a while back. I figured this would be a great proper Python project: Develop a Static Site Generator designed to manage all my resumes and make it easy to spin up new ones on the fly. 

**Introducing:** *Highlight.* An opinionated Static Site Generator to help you manage multiple versions of your resume in a simple, elegant way. Generates a static website with print-friendly styles. You can use it locally or make it public and upload the results to GitHub Pages or anywhere that serves static sites.

Uses YAML for handling site, bio, and resume data; markdown for standard pages.

**Github:** [https://github.com/annedorko/highlight](https://github.com/annedorko/highlight)

Installation and detailed usage instructions are available on the Github README.

**Python libraries used:**

* Python-Markdown
* PyYAML
* Jinja2
* watchdog
* unicode\_slugify

**How it works:**

1. Set up the project.
2. Customize your overall information: Name, timezone, email, etc.
3. Customize your target roles, examples:   
*Front End Developer, WordPress Developer, Content Writer*
4. Add your work history! Each item has a default value, or you can customize job roles and descriptions for specific target roles. You can also choose whether a work item should be included on *All* target role resumes, or just specific ones.
5. Edit your pages, i.e. About, Contact, or delete those and make different ones.
6. Generate your static resume site. 
7. ???
8. Profit.

**Previews of the result:**

**Future features:**

Today I finished the first main feature: Quickly spinning up custom versions of my resume without having to rewrite lots of text or go digging in old resumes to find specific descriptions or optimizations. It’s all in one place! I can send out the hosted web versions, or simply print to PDF.

The next feature I want to build out is portfolio pages. It will work functionally similar but focus on showcasing projects and results over job titles. It will need to be flexible enough to handle portfolios for business and data projects, writing samples, and multimedia projects. 

**Final thoughts:**

Why this and not, say, work from an existing Static Site Generator? I was going to. Then, I realized I had a very specific goal and wanted the experience of building something like this from scratch. Learning another SSG from the ground up to build on top of seemed unnecessary. 

This was a super fun project, and I’m extremely happy I was able to throw this together in just a few days. I want to build it out to be more robust with error catching, command-line scripts for adding new work history, and other handy tools if others are interested in using it.

I expected to run into more issues, but Python was a breeze! The majority of my career has been PHP development, but I’m already spoiled by not dealing with brackets, amongst how intuitive it is to think in Python (and I’m sure I’ve barely scratched the surface). There are so many powerful libraries and I can’t wait to learn more about building production-quality tools. This is definitely still a hackathon level product and needs testing.

What do you think? Is this useful for anyone else? Any cool features, improvements, fixes that are immediately obvious that I haven’t mentioned?

Using Python, OpenCV, Numpy, and PyTorch, I built my own virtual background effect.

# Method 1

The first method we explore is generating a mask using background plate. I've actually used this in a gesture recognition project and you can check that out [here](https://github.com/jrobchin/Computer-Vision-Basics-with-Python-Keras-and-OpenCV).

The idea is to capture the background and then comparing the captured frame to each new frame. Each pixel that is close enough to the background frame will be subtracted, and each different pixel will be kept.

# Method 2

The second method uses a deep neural network that performs image segmentation on each frame of video. Each pixel that is detected as the subject is left in frame, while the background segments are subtracted.

Dashborg is a frontend framework that lets you build webapps and internal tools with HTML and Python.  No JavaScript or frontend stack required.

* Define Your UI in HTML
* Write your handlers in Python
* Run your program to to deploy your app

Setting up a frontend stack can be a huge pain, especially when you just want to create a quick one-off webapp.  The handler code is straightforward, but if you want to include JavaScript (dropdowns, modals, AJAX, etc.) a quick project can quickly snowball with Webpack, Babel, React, Bootstrap, state management, etc.  Then you still need to deploy and secure it (user accounts? permissions?).  You often end up with more code, frameworks, configuration, files, and modules on the frontend than in your backend!

The point of the assignment was to show us how boring and difficult it can be for error-prone humans to have to repeatedly do an algorithm. This would lead him into introducing us to our first programming language: Python.

Anyway, I didn't feel like doing it his way. I know just enough Python that I decided to write a program to do all the work for me. Did I unnecessarily complicate things? Maybe. Did it take me an absurdly longer amount of time than just doing the assignment? Ha! ... yes. I have no regrets.

TLDR: I unnecessarily made a program that is more complex than my homework which it was created to complete just so I could use it one time because I can't be told to do otherwise.

The package **lambdex** allows you to write complicated anonymous functions other than the built-in `lambda`s. Take a recursive function that calculates Fibonacci series as an example:

    from lambdex import def_
    def_(lambda n: [
        if_[n &lt;= 0] [
            raise_[ValueError(f'{n} should be positive')]
        ],
        if_[n &lt;= 2] [
            return_[1]
        ],
        return_[callee_(n - 1) + callee_(n - 2)]  # Recursion
    ])(10)  # 55

In the code above, we declare an anonymous function with multiple imperative statements inside, which is more or less similar to the closure in Rust or arrow function in Javascript. There are keywords such as `if_` or `raise_` emulating Python control flows, and brackets `[]` to group statements. Currently, **lambdex** supports nearly all the structures in Python (including the async/await suite), plus several optional language extensions for advanced features.

The ""new syntax"" requires NO modification on the Python interpreter. Instead it transpiles the ASTs and compiles them to bytecodes at runtime. Even so, **lambdex** has rather small runtime overhead, since each compiled code object will be cached.

Besides, **lambdex** provides a formatter for the new syntax, in order to provide better programming experience. The formatter could easily co-operate with other formatters like `yapf`, so that minor changes should be made to enjoy it in an IDE or editor.

968,1612986986.0,0.0,lgs49e,t3,6.0,"Hi all,

I am trying to figure out whether I should use celery for a full workflow, or whether just use it for parts of a workflow - what do you all think?  Is celery even the best tool!?

&amp;#x200B;

* I have a web application where a user submits a data file.  
* A few different validation scripts check the file (this can take some time).  
* An email is sent to an admin
* If the file passes the validation step, it waits for an admin user to have a look at the file and validate it
* If the admin doesn't approve the file in X days, a reminder email is sent
* If the file is validated, then maybe another user has to do something/maybe a report is generated

This is a simple version of the workflow, and there may be different steps (more/less emails, more/less approvers, more/less processing against the file) - also imagine there are lots of people submitting different files which have slightly different workflows associated.

Does it makes sense to use celery and generate a single workflow which encompasses all of these steps (including the ones where you wait for a user action) for each file type, or would it make more sense to store the workflow/steps in a table, and only pass the automated tasks individually to celery?

Maybe asked differently, does celery make a good workflow manager for a file that requires user interaction in some steps, or is it more optimized towards individual tasks in a workflow, and I manage the workflow outside of celery?

Thanks all :-)",Python,Celery is this a good use case?,6.0,1.0,

These may happen earlier or later depending on the implementation strategy, the only constraint being that capture variables must be set before guards that use them explicitly are evaluated.

972,1612977104.0,0.0,lgpwsu,t3,0.0,"So I've mostly taught myself python from googling with a goal, and I'm just starting a computer science program at a college. They do not allow break or continue, so I've figured out this method of avoiding pointless boolean loop variables, especially for input validation. 

better examples:

    while 'var' not in locals():
        try:
            var = int(input('enter an integer'))
        except ValueError:
            print('unacceptable input')
            # var is not assigned if ValueError is raised, loop restarts

    while 'var' not in locals():
        var = input('enter a whole number over 665')
        if var.isdecimal() and (var := int(var)) &gt;= 666:
            print('Hail Satan')
        else:
            print('this isn't a whole number over 665')
            del var
            # del as a ""continue""
            # and, yeah, walruses, feel free to chime in about those

    var_values = (2, 3, 7, 9)
    while 'var' not in locals() or var not in var_values:
        x = 1 if 'x' not in locals() else x + 1
        var = x ** 2
        # figures out 9 is the first perfect square in var_values (just an example)
        # Also let me know about the ternary operator usage because I just realized it's possible.

Since I'm mostly self taught and trying to learn conventions, I want to learn to do things the zen of python one obvious way, is there anything wrong with this pseudo-do while in python? Is this conventional, avoided for some reason, rare because people don't realize it's possible, or something I haven't thought of?

My arguments for it:

- It's explicitly stating the while loop will continue until the variable is assigned (and, with or, is an acceptable value).

- If a condition after or is present, it completely prevents the condition after or from being checked until the relevant variable is assigned

- del var_name can be used as a more explicit continue, with or without a condition after or.

My arguments against:

- break and continue are simpler and not more confusing than this or loop booleans in concise loops

- Putting a variable name in a string is confusing? (lol?)

Hello everyone, this is a project I've built with Python + FastAPI to easily mock up an API. You simply define your endpoints in a `.yaml` file and you are ready to go in two minutes. 

It supports functions inside the response body, e.g. you can have an employees endpoint that returns random names - so you don't just see ""John Doe"" at every request :).

Great for demos, hackathons and front-end development (when the real API is not ready). It's also great for when you are prototyping an API.
