It would have to be a federal issue like the impeachment where a third or majority of the senate could then vote to invoke the 4th branch where All Americans can then vote in this federal issue. A majority vote of the people would invoke and then all questions pertaining would be included. Such as yes invoke. Then 2nd question would be issue, is trump guilty of inciting a riot. Then ask follow ups. Did those elected officials who voted yea follow oath of office to the constitution? How about those who voted no? Should those who voted against oath of office or constitution be held accountable? Did all branches of government follow their oath of office to the constitution during this process? Should they be held accountable?  

I ask because it is obvious this has turned to voting for party/beliefs/money/power and not according to constitution or what is good for the people. There has to be something to turn this from a capitalist oligarchy.  Is this a legal option for the American people?"

I personally know some Republicans involved in this effort, and they told me that public schools were ""no good"" and were just pushing 'liberal' philosophies and not teaching them anything.  When I pointed out that most children would not get educated at all if public schools were abolished, they said, these children starting age 9 could go into workhouses and do low paid labor to learn a ""skill"".

Probably multiple times tbh.

But the more I think about it, Trump seems very likely to run again in 2024 either as a Republican again or in his own party if he wanted to start that. If he were to start his own political party, he would essentially be splitting the republican vote almost guaranteeing that democrats win the next election.

If he runs as a Republican, we already know he can't win against Biden and people will come out in huge numbers to vote for him and especially against him. Him running again basically ensures another 4 years of democratic control.

Trump has been a god awful president but he's done a great service to democrats by splitting the republican party. 

If congress votes to remove him, he can't run again in 2024 and they're going to be more likely to be unified and have a stronger chance of winning in 2024 and beyond. 

It'd be smart for Republicans to remove him but I'm honestly hoping they don't, because as long as Trump and people like him are still around, it only further divided the republican party"

I am attempting to apply pure logic to the situation. (also, I think it was bullshit to bring it up in today's hearings. It just got me thinking)

So: we separate competitive sports into men's and women's divisions not because of any locker room privacy issue, but because there are genuine differences in typical strength and reach and weight etc. between men and women. Therefore it is not considered fair for the two to compete directly. 

I am assuming that a trans person under the age of 18 is pre-op and not taking hormones yet. (I may be mistaken here?) Therefore, their physical body at birth still corresponds to the gender division we all agree to have for competitive sports. 

As others have said, in wrestling for example athletes are further divided into weight classes, and this is not an issue. But in something like track, or another sport where there is a clear difference between what a typical male can achieve and what a typical female can achieve, it seems to me that a female who is obligated to wear a male's body until she can legally correct it still has kind of an unfair advantage when competing with females? 

But then again, a post-op trans person will still have pretty much the strength or reach or whatever that goes with their body type independent of their gender. 

I honestly don't know all the facts but I would like to formulate a position on this issue that is well-informed and respectful."

I consider myself a classical liberal (fiscally conservative social liberal), on the European centre right. I wouldn't necessarily call myself a liberal in the American sense. 

I have a question for people in the first stage of tertiary education at uni/college (18-22), particularly if you are at a relatively prestigious and liberal leaning one. Without giving too much away, my work means I deal with a lot of students from this age. Now, there is a tendency in political leanings towards a strain of 'liberalism' - honestly what I would describe as judgmental moaner-lisa soft socialism. It's the classic tale of students decked in 'wavy' garms telling the world what they think government policy should be towards the homeless... 

I often give this crowd the benefit of the doubt, mainly because I sympathise with a lot. I agree, for example, the UK Govt should do more for the homeless but within the current budget - though this is another conversation. 

So this generation puts a lot of emphasis on mental health. This is good. I agree with this to a large extent. 

How do you, then, justify the Crucible-like scorn that seems to be thrown upon anyone breaking COVID regulations? Again, I'm no COVID denier. I think that yes the 100-strong raves that the police seem to find every weekend are irresponsible and dangerous. I'm talking about the bullying I've seen happen towards people who were spotted with something like 3 house guests that they were not supposed to have. I'm not saying go to a full blown rave, I'm not saying don't wash your hands or wear a mask. I'm saying why the fuck do you tell people their mental health is the most important thing in the world, but then shut down literally any gathering that is in slightest breach of COVID restrictions? Surely you can see how one helps and feeds the other. And surely you can see that while there are risks, everything in life is a trade off.

And sure, much of this is online and keyboard warriors have always existed. But I feel there is something very very sinister about this - people seem to be robots, trying to programme themselves and others into destruction.

From the article:

>Former President  Donald J. Trump and the Republican Party entered this year having  stockpiled more than $175 million from fund-raising in November and  December based on his false claims of voter fraud, spending only a tiny  fraction on lawyers and bills for his effort to overturn the  presidential election, according to new campaign finance reports filed  on Sunday night.  
>  
>The picture that emerges in the new Federal Election Commission reports is  of Mr. Trump mounting a furious public relations effort to spread the  lie and keep generating money from it, rather than making a sustained  legal push to try to support his conspiracy theories.  
>  
>His  campaign’s single biggest expense in December was a nearly $5 million  media buy paid to the firm that bought his television advertisements.  His second-largest payment, $4.4 million, was for online advertising.  And the Republican National Committee pocketed millions of dollars in  donations — collecting 25 cents for every dollar Mr. Trump raised online  — in the final weeks of the year as it spent relatively little on legal  costs.  
>  
>All  told, Mr. Trump’s campaign spent only $10 million on legal costs —  about one-fifth of what it spent on advertising and fund-raising,  according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission filings from  Nov. 4 through the end of the year.  
>  
>During  that period, Mr. Trump’s conspiracy-fueled accusations that votes had  been miscounted or misappropriated repeatedly fell flat in the courts.  Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected president by voters on Nov. 3, confirmed  by the Electoral College on Dec. 14 and ratified by Congress on Jan. 6 —  the same day that Mr. Trump incited a mob that stormed the Capitol.  
>  
>But  while Mr. Trump’s efforts to de-legitimize the election did not keep him  in power, they did spur millions in contributions from loyal supporters  and provided both him and the party with an enormous infusion of cash.

I'm just sitting here recalling all the times t\*\*\*\* and republicans endlessly kvetched about Obama making ""millions"" ""during"" his presidency; the facts are that Obama made money off of book deals following his tenure.

t\*\*\*\* actively spent his entire presidency grifting, lying, and destroying anything and anyone that got in the way of his grifting.

Meanwhile, like brain-dead tithers, the cult continues to put money in t\*\*\*\*'s collection plate, thinking they're ""fighting for 'murica.""

\-Joe Biden will be a one term president

\- The U.S. will enter into a depression 

\- Tea party 2.0 touting deregulation, lower taxes, less spending and more jobs while blaming liberal democrats

\- Mike Pence will be elected president in 2024 

&#x200B;

As a democrat it is important to tame my expectations for the next 4 years. I remember how Obama was steamrolled by republicans in his 8 years in office. This is because republicans uphold the United States as a dominating world power and will continue to do so. Kennedy was assassinated for trying to make the United States more compliant on the world stage. Those in power want to preserve their control not because they are smarter and know how to move forward, but because that is what an aristocracy only knows how to do. So they hammered the naive idealistic Obama for 8 years, and I expect the same for the next 4 Biden years. 

And the stage is already set: High unemployment, mutating virus, overpriced markets. The market will crash, there will be more virus infections, and more people will become unemployed. Biden will pass a stimulus just like Obama did and... republicans will come out opposing high spending which... will incite a tea party 2.0. No doubt you will see more people protesting in washington. Do I sound too pessimistic? 

Just before leaving the Trump administration cut off Fed emergency lending programs that have helped the economy rebound from March 2020 possibly sabotaging a current weak economy from future help. What more can I say? Also, I wouldn't be surprised if mass shootings make the news again, because you need angry gun loving folks voting in 2024 to keep the democrats from taking their guns. 

All in all I wish everyone the best and to prepare for the shitshow that will unfold. Stay safe everyone."

Now I am not F\*\*\*\*\*\* excusing the neo-liberals here as well.  Look at the absolute sham that is going on at CNBC right now.  It is just as bad as Fox News.  Tell me it isn't.   Please can one neo-liberal tell me how you can defend the actions of these hedge funds who use shorting strategies to destroy companies, thereby making countless people lose their jobs?  

I honestly think these classifications of our political identities are too broad.  Economically, I am a heterodox interventionist liberal, meaning I am all for the free market, but there needs to be some oversight.  Socially, I believe in equality in every regard: race, religion, sexual orientation, whatever.  

What this movement that WSB has started is something I thought I'd never see.  It has given me hope to such a degree that the power of the internet in banding communities together to fight back against institutionalized corruption.  What we are witnessing here is the very fight for our future and for the first time we are WINNING.  The internet has finally been able to organize all its autists and retards into one united voice. 

Back when Jimmy Carter won the Presidency in 1977, the Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress.  Big businesses were so scared that they created something called the Big Business Roundtable.  The prospects of a completely liberal government scared the piss out of them and they pulled in the resources to combat it.  They won.  They managed to neutralize most of what the progressives were trying to accomplish thus creating this lobbyist-infested swamp of a political system we see now in America. **THE POWER OF ORGANIZATION IS KEY TO MAKING INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.**

What we are witnessing right now is the little guys, the ""peasants"" that were looked down on by the wealthy finally organizing using the INTERNET.  It is my hope that what the autists at WallStreetBets started will light the tinder-box for us to come together and say NO YOU CAN'T F\*\*\*\*\*\* KEEP F\*\*\*\*\*\* US.  **THE POWER OF ORGANIZATION IS KEY AND WE CAN USE THE INTERNET TO BRING MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN A SOCIETY THAT IS SPIRALING DOWN INTO IMMORALITY.**  

Now I know they're going to say market manipulation this, market manipulation that, but these F\*\*\*\*\* hedge funds have been organizing and devising markets to completely ruin for decades.  They don't want us ""lowlies"" to have access to what they have achieved by working with one another.

In conclusion, all I have to say is this: it's not about the money, it's about the message.  DIAMOND F\*\*\*\*\*\* HANDS"

I have strong liberal values. Pro-choice, pro-environment, BLM, LGBT rights, universal healthcare, pro-union, etc. I believe in having a strong government and regulations to ensure that these values are protected. However, I HATE it when I come to face with these regulations. For example, I hate having to update my car’s registration and think “I take care of my car, why do I have to do this? I’m not the problem”. I have to remind myself the benefits of this system and how I wouldn’t want to get rid of it as to ensure our community’s vehicles are safe for all. I have to remind myself that I cannot be an exception so comply accordingly. A similar situation is all the training I have to do for work. Again, it’s to protect values important to me but I have a tendency to think that this shouldn’t apply to me and it’s unnecessary. I feel bad when this occurs since it’s hypocritical to want a system but be exempt from it and it’s also sorta conservative which I cannot stand nor want to be part of. Does anyone else ever have these feelings?"

Lawmakers were forced to grab gas masks and go to secure locations.  The President fomented this for days.  Twitter shut his account down.  A rioter was shot in the melee, but generally the police were incredibly soft on the terrorists....Unlike their response to BLM protests that were gassed and harassed by a helicopter at low altitude so that President Trump could take a photo op with a Bible.  

All because they “feel” like the election was stolen from Trump.  No solid evidence, mind you.  50 or more court cases have been dismissed for a complete lack of evidence or standing, including two in the SCOTUS.  

Thanks, Trump voters.  Thanks for this.  It’s been “neat.”   

This man never had the character to serve as president.  To hell with policies.  You voted for a madman because he said he is conservative.  

Cue all the shocked Trump voters.  “Well, I didn’t know the face eating leopard was going to eat my face!”   Get out with that mess.  Get out of here.  

Shame.  Shame on you for not listening to your heart about this vile man.....or if you don’t have enough heart to have felt this was wrong, for just being an idiot and falling for this carnival barker.  A freaking pox on your house.  You literally might have broken our democracy."

I am a life long conservative. As in never voted for a democrat in my short 10 years of voting, save this year. Mike Espy is the first Democrat I’ve ever voted for. That information should tell you enough about where I live, and just how conservative it is. 

After the last 4 years of Trump, and seeing everything happen in the Senate even this week, I am DONE with the Republican Party. 

My problem is. I’m pro life, which obviously the Democratic Party is pro choice. I am not coming here to be explained to how I’m wrong for being pro life or anything like that. I just want help on how to navigate it. How can I vote for someone who may not be “pro life” but is still the better candidate? How do I reconcile the two? Basically I want someone to tell me it’s ok to be pro life, but understand I need to vote for the best person for the overall job I guess. Thank you."

I am liberal and my dad is an extreme Trump supporter. Over the past 4 years, it has been hard. As a result in the recent months, we setup a civil debate on topics that we alternate who decides. I'm looking for anyone with any experience in this and can offer some advice.

Here is my story...

# Background

I grew up approx. 40 minutes outside New York City. Both of my father's parents are liberals. My dad is educated, Jewish, has an immigrant wife, had an abortion for his girlfriend at 22, exposed to diversity on a regular basis since he works in NYC and at one point was considered liberal.

He became a republican, when Bush ran, for financial reasons. However, he is now a pro-life, anti-liberal, gun obsessed, Fox News loving, all in Trump fanatic. He reasons and believes every one of Trump's lies(and those who support him).

When Trump was elected in 2016, I tried to avoid all talks about politics to avoid the blow up fights. To be honest, it ate away at me every day. I thought to myself how could this privileged and educated man be so brainwashed. This summer when COVID hit and BLM protests broke out I started to boil. I thought about how to approach the situation with my dad and my execution went pretty poorly. It ended up being a phone call where he was screaming ""planned parenthood is a baby killing mill"" and more outrageous comments.

At that point I froze, this man who told me when I was younger I could be whatever I wanted, to look at all people equally and inclusiveness is better than exclusiveness was not the man who I was talking to. I told him straight-up I don't see us having more than surface level relationship and I can't have this toxicity in my life. I told him I thought he was on the wrong side of history, which actually brought silence, I felt that got to him for some reason(but thats an assumption). I also continued to tell him that his uneducated and unverified claims did not warrant such an emotional response. Surprisingly, at that point my dad suggested we do monthly debates.

# The Debate

Each month we alternate who picks a topic. After he suggested this I put together a debate doc to help structure each debate. I even had us put our goals down for what we want to achieve in this process, so we can remind ourselves whenever things got heated. The structure is we have 2-3 days to pick a topic after our prior debate, 2 weeks for us to both provide research(articles, documentaries, videos, etc.) to support our claim and then an additional 2 weeks to review each others research.

The first topic I decided on was **False information is a serious problem with irreversible consequences that cause a massive divide in America.** I did this to plan how we would conduct our research, deem what sources are credible, decide on tools we would use to fact check and define certain terms. This was setup to prevent a back and forth on what is fact and fiction.

I wanted to encourage him to think twice before believing information he read from biased sources and  verify his information using other sources. A goal of mine is to have productive debates based on educated, well sourced and non-partisan content. While agreeing that some of our content would be biased and left/right leaning, but the claims made need to be based on **credible facts**.

My research included:

* [How Your Brain Tricks You Into Believing Fake News](https://time.com/5362183/the-real-fake-news-crisis/)
* HBO's [After Truth](https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/after-truth-disinformation-and-the-cost-of-fake-news)
* A [John Oliver clip](https://www.hbo.com/video/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/seasons/season-7/episodes/138-episode-197/videos/july-19-2020-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories)
* [YouTube Radicalization](https://medium.com/@markoledwich/youtube-radicalization-an-authoritative-saucy-story-28f73953ed17) \- this was to help show my understanding that even liberals can produce fake news. My goal was to help see that I try to find the truth with FACTS over opinion.

His research included:

* [This is how fake news spreads](https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/01/14/this-is-how-fake-news-spreads/)
* A article that no longer exists, but essentially it  discussed Google extending fact checking to image search
* Unfreedom Press by Mark Levin, that we both agreed was far too long to get through in 2 weeks - *Reddit even reported this as fake, so I removed the link*

My approach to this, was to review the limited research he provided. I read Dennis Pragner's article and it seemed apparent this guy focused on his opinion over facts. First, I used a few fact checkers on Dennis to see his credibility, which was amazingly low. To prove this, I went through roughly 10-15 of Dennis's most recent articles and put together data.

* One spreadsheet listed his 13 most recent articles how many times he used the words left leaning words such a **Left, Democrat,** and **Liberal** and right leaning words such as **Right, Conservative** and **Republican.**
* Then I researched top spin words & phrases, subjective statements and emotional terms to see how he was using emotion to persuade his audience of his claims. I created a doc highlighting how often he used these terms.
* Also in the doc with the content from his articles I made a list of all words that he surrounded the left leaning terms he used in the first spreadsheet.

My results were that he used used *112 left leaning words* and *8 right leaning words*. Some examples of the words he used surrounding the left included:

* Every *leftist*
* Lying
* Russian collusion
* Indistinguishable
* Brands
* Abolish standards
* As they have done for decades
* Denounce
* Reaction
* Mantra
* Bringing America down
* The communists
* Don’t give a damn
* *If* *the left* cared

Anyway, without my opinion and solely using Dennis's words I was able to convince my dad that Dennis was not credible. It was a victory I did not think I'd get so easily. I felt after our first debate that we made real progress. He even went as far to say ""Yeah, I don't know why I was getting so emotional and I won't read Dennis Pragner anymore"" It was awesome.

The victory I felt was not based on that he agreed with me, but that we were able to agree on verifiable facts. This is and has been my goal so far. Let's get past debating what is verifiably true, since to me it's common sense and obvious, and let's focus on factual information that we can discuss.

As a result from our first debate we agreed upon certain definitions, a few tools we can use to fact check and how we would judge credibility and that we want to avoid content with extreme bias.  In addition, we shared an understanding that there will be manipulation and bias in documentaries, articles, etc., we send each other to persuade the audience of what the author is saying. However, the claims, evidence and research the author presents must be factual. **There is a difference of using manipulation and bias to convince the audience of false information and verified information.** This is what we as an audience have to judge, is the bias or manipulation credible?

# The Problem

However, it feels like all the work I am doing and how far we get, the progress just reverts. I'm frustrated and don't know when I should just throw in the towel. The second debate we had, my dad decided on **Appointment of Supreme Court Justices**. The debate was ok, but I didn't spend as much time as I did in the first debate. I learned a lot, however I felt there wasn't much for us to debate. However, I still felt we were on the right track and agreed upon being factual versus emotional/opinionated on unverifiable facts. His research supported this and was way more interesting and factual this time around.

For our upcoming debate I decided on **The Republican Party’s Conflict with Science & How it Affected America’s Response to COVID-19**. Both of our research was due last Thursday and here is the list:

My research:

* [Totally Under Control](https://www.hulu.com/movie/totally-under-control-4e196a01-bdeb-4b2b-903d-492b65f9e337)
* [Trump’s COVID Death Toll, Physical & Economic](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kotlikoff/2020/10/29/trumps-covid-death-tolls-physical-and-economic---an-informed-assessment/?sh=27d127686d5d)

* [A Sensible and Compassionate Anti-COVID Strategy](https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/sensible-compassionate-anti-covid-strategy/?utm_term=emailclicks&utm_campaign=imprimis&utm_medium=housefile-email&_hsmi=98690753&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9k8qDZgV-TFamTIpUNpPp3hyR86Vzn95oIJtK1Q7eeuZ1IPVHEGpsBuO7HCun2VtMf48ypDCX-zVReAGGamAEiUohXvg&utm_content=SensibleAntiCOVIDStrategyOCT&utm_source=email)

Initially I read the Breitbart article, [CDC Journal: Cloth Mask 'May give users a False Sense of Protection' against Coronavirus'](https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/10/28/cdc-journal-cloth-masks-may-give-users-a-false-sense-of-protection-against-coronavirus/), which refers to COVID-19 as the Chinese virus(first red flag). From the fake news discussion, I felt we were aligned. I don't want to have to go through the exercise I already did or use the limited time we have for our debate on what is credible information. I had hoped we were moving past this. I decided to message him ""it's hard for me to take an article seriously, when they are consistently referring to COVID-19 as the Chinese virus."" We had a small back and forth, but it was civil and he understood. In addition, I searched a few fact checkers on Breitbart's credibility and it's labeled as a questionable source, extreme right-wing bias and publication of conspiracy theories and propaganda with numerous false claims. It shows he did zero fact checking here, which we agreed we would do with our research.

Then I started watching **Fibs, Falsehoods and Fauci**, done by Mark Levin on BlazeTV.  The main topic was discussing Trump's ad campaign and using Fauci saying in an interview ""I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more"" in regards to Trump. I got about 10 minutes and felt defeated. I know the situation well and knew Mark Levin was claiming verifiably false information as true. So, in our google doc, I flagged this video as verifiably false and stated that I conducted minimal research into BlazeTV's credibility. My findings were that BlazeTV has some credibility concerns.

We are currently in a back and forth on this topic, *yet again*. I'm am spending a TON of time and energy on this. Repeating to myself that I gotta put my all into this and if it doesn't work out I know I had done everything I could.

I haven't gone through the rest of his research, but I'm just feeling super down and hopeless. When do I know I need to walk away? How do I know if I should keep trying? I'm conflicted and frustrated. I always believed the truth would prevail and set me free, but it feels like the truth is being used against me."

I worked for a Union insurance company for a while and they always asked me why I took a job there like it was some kind of bad thing. I've never really understood why but according to how they think, it's because they are always backed by Democrats. That's literally the only reason I can think of or see.

Since Trump took office they have both supported ""made in America"" products and companies. I brought to their attention that Trump and Ivanka both have their clothing line made in China, which they just choose to ignore. Just looking at some of the swag I've gotten from various campaigns and candidates, they all have Union labels on them and are made in the US. A majority of the Trump flags that I've seen people with are made in China. I checked a few in my neighborhood, and they were all made in China.

I've read a few places that Union members actually voted for Trump in a higher percentage this election. That's alarming to me.

What I don't understand is why Republicans still seem to overwhelmingly be against Unions if they want to support working class people and made in America businesses. Is it purely the politics of AFL-CIO being a Democrat backer? Is there something else I'm missing? Some untold backstory I don't know?"

 Challenge them. Or better yet, don't just wait for them to lie so that you can try to fact check afterward. It's too late by then. 

Be proactive. You're in the right. If they have no shame in lying, why do you have shame for speaking the truth? Even if you're only 90% accurate, it's better than the willfully deceitful BS we have to contend with.

Don't be afraid of confrontation or being a little wrong in the face of total ignorance. We all know that idiot relative who says the stupidest shit over Thanksgiving without anyone asking. No shame, no reasoning... so why's it always a right wing sack of shit doing it?"

The kind of bills that polls repeatedly show a majority of Americans support, regardless of party.

Then emphasize that ONLY a vote for a Democrat to the Senate will EVER allow these bills to see the light of day.

 (not to mention forcing the Republican senators to go on record as having voted against these bills. Hell, it would not even be untrue to portray them as having effectively voted against them ALREADY, as they refuse to replace McConnell.)

Today a few things happened to me:

1. We got a nasty-gram from our neighbor who we've never once discussed politics with in 4 years.  We've always been pleasant with her and her husband. She told us that we have a lot of hate in our heart and she's praying for us. We have no yard signs. No banners. Nothing. But we do have a Biden sticker on our fridge that she spotted one day when she came over.
2. A Republican told me that he was boycotting all liberal owned businesses because they deserve to lose the shirt off their back.
3. A family member told me that I better not show my face around them for a while.

Hey guys. I myself would identify as conservative. Grew up in a fairly liberal household and over time for a myriad of reasons pertaining to my career etc. have been more conservative.

I think an integral part to progressing as a nation and as cohesive people is the ability to accept that: things may or may not have gone the way you hoped for in the recent election, but we have stand behind the winning candidate because like it or not, that is your president. 

I personally did not vote for Joe Biden for reasons relating to my personal finances and the industry I am in, but from the looks of it, he’s going to be running shop the next 4 years. We’re never going to get anywhere if the right retreats so far right, and the left retreats so far left. 

We are always going to disagree on issues, and more often than not our stances are going to be directly correlated to our personal situation or life experiences. I think it’s important to be understanding and realize that we are not going to agree on everything. 

My question is this, what do you think we can do to open the line of communication between different demographics to reduce hostility? Both sides have become increasingly defensive, and it’s gotten far from healthy. How can we learn to accept our differences but move together for the greater good of our country and communities at a community level?

Thank you guys!"

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) was enacted to insure that the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was enforced and that no one, including federal, state or local government may in any way impede people from registering to vote or voting because of their race or ethnicity. Most provisions in the VRA, and specifically the portions that guarantee that no one may be denied the right to vote because of his or her race or color, are permanent.

Section 5 of the VRA requires certain states or jurisdictions which have an established history of laws or policies which discriminate obtain advance approval or “preclearance” from the US Department of Justice or the US District Court for D.C. before they can make any changes to voting practices or procedures.  Examples of these changes which must be “precleared” include any change in the date, time, place, or manner under which an election is held. Federal approval is to be given as soon as the state or jurisdiction proves that the proposed change would not abridge the right to vote on account of race or language minority status.

On June 25, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in the case of Shelby v. Holder in which the Court did not invalidate the principle of preclearance. The Supreme Court did decide, however, that Section 4(b) of the VRA, which establishes the formula that is used to determine which states and jurisdictions must comply with preclearance, is antiquated and thus unconstitutional and can no longer be used. Thus, although Section 5 prevailed, it is currently not being used.  The U.S. Supreme Court also made it clear in its decision that a new, updated preclearance formula can and should be designed by the U.S. Congress, and signed into law.

Do they try to get back to pre-Trump conservatism, or is that completely over now?

\--

For 4 years now, we’ve seen the GOP celebrate the rise of Trump, their power grabs in the courts, say “get over it”, and laugh about “liberal tears”. Whether Trump is reelected or not, one thing will happen; eventually he will leave office. I imagine the vast majority of Republicans never think much about what will happen after he leaves office. They are usually so focused on the here and now.

I started thinking about this in the last few weeks for a handful of reasons:

* We are seeing more and more Republicans, some high profile, supporting Biden
* We have Republican PACs fundraising for Biden
* We have Republican groups like the Lincoln Project working hard to smear Trump
* People that I know personally that voted for Trump refuse to do so this time
* Mitch McConnell has urged GOP senators that are up for reelection to distance themselves from Trump because he is very aware of how toxic he is and being too close to him could harm any reelection chances that they may have.

Yes, Trump is toxic and has remade the GOP in his own image. But after he is gone and the GOP is left trying to pickup the pieces, what will it look like then?

Prior to Trump being elected, one thing that united all of the Republicans I know was their loathing of Democrats and anyone liberal. Some of the more detailed reasons were always 2nd amendment rights or abortion but it always came down to an “us and them” type feeling at the end of the day.

Right now, it’s easy to look at the GOP and feel like it is very splintered. As I mentioned, you have many  Republicans supporting Biden. You have extremist, right wing Trump supporters. You have single issue voting Trump supporters. You have Republicans that will just refuse to vote because they don’t like Trump but can’t vote for Biden. One could argue that the Democratic Party felt split like this in 2016 because of the massive support Sanders had (and still has to some degree), yet the Democratic Party still feels more cohesive and united than it has in a long time. At least to me it feels that way, though, I’m sure others feel differently.

Part of me feels there will always be the question of whether a Republican was a Trump supporter or not. Kind of like whether or not a German soldier was just following orders from higher up or were they instrumental in orchestrating a master plan in the Third Reich?

I enjoy seeing post by the Lincoln Project, but then I find myself reminded that these are Republicans doing this. What will happen after Trump is gone? Will they redraw the line in the sand and say “well, it’s been fun…..now go back to your side.” I hope not honestly. I’d like to see some common ground and bipartisanship continue for the better of the country.

I read an article today saying that officials in the Trump administration have started looking for jobs and people like Sean Spicer have shared with them that it will be much harder for them to find a job than they think it will be. Touting “I worked for the Trump administration” isn’t going to be something great to have on your resume unless you want to continue working in the bubble of Conservatism that is dealing in conspiracy theories and extremism. Not that everyone cares about what happens with people in this administration, but it illustrates that eventually, Republicans have a reckoning coming to them that I don’t think they know how to deal with yet.  I had actually thoughts that, by now at least, people would start quitting the Trump administration in masse.

And what I fear most, after Trump is gone, it’s going to be incredibly hard to to fight off a GOP that continues down the road of recruiting based on extremism verses decency. Conservatism wouldn’t be “Conservatism” at that point. It will just be Trumpism. Is that where the GOP is ultimately headed? I do predict that there will be some loyal Trump politicians that will immediately start to work on trying to tear apart the next administration, whether it be Biden or not. I also think that they will see it as time for revenge instead of trying to move on. Will it take voting out every single complicit Republican to be able to move on at this point? We all know that will never happen in some of the deep red states. It kind of seemed like Ben Sasse was trying to setup some kind of aftermath of Trump for himself.

Trumpism isn’t going to go away quickly I’m afraid. I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a new News Channel dedicated to extremist views of Trumpism even beyond what FoxNews pushes. Maybe even hosted by the Führer himself.

I would love to hear others thoughts on this.

UPDATE: I just want to take a second to compliment everyone on how great of a discussion and how civil it's been. "

All I'm doing is asking people their plans to vote--where, when, and how. 

For those who are interested, but not entirely sure about their plan, I field off a state-specific site on voting locations.

**Trump, Biden to hold separate, dueling town halls as opposed to originally scheduled debate**

Thursday (10/15) was originally scheduled as the second 2020 presidential debate. President Trump refused to participate when the debate commission decided to host the event virtually (due to concerns about Covid-19). In place, both Trump and Biden are hosting town halls tonight at 8pm Eastern. Some critics say that both town halls occurring at the same time does a disservice to voters. They argue that making it inconvenient for voters to watch both town halls is harmful to democracy. 

**Pelosi and Mnuchin continue talk of a stimulus package**

Today, Nancy Pelosi (Speaker of the House) and Steven Mnuchin (Treasury) continued to move close to an agreement on a stimulus package. Trump is unhappy with Pelosi’s demands, claiming she is putting forth unreasonable requests. Mnuchin is also displeased with Pelosi’s demands. Meanwhile, Pelosi states that democrats can not “cave” to the GOP and should continue to make sweeping demands. 

**Vote for Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation set for October 22**

The Judiciary Committee has set a date to vote for Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court: October 22. After this vote, the confirmation process will move to the Senate, where there will be another vote. This date has not been set as of now.

The other day, I was walking around my neighborhood lake and passed an older white man wearing a Jesus T-shirt. The next time we both passed each other, he asked me something, to which I had to take my headphones out to listen. 

For context- I’m a white female 27 living in a rural southern community. I was wearing a “black lives matter” tshirt. 

This man’s first thing out of his mouth was asking me if I, “knew that planned parenthood killed more black babies every year than any other race? Why doesn’t BLM address that?”

He got angry, obviously not wanting to a engage in a fruitful discussion but instead berate his neighbors in an ignorant, condescending way. 

I tried to politely tell him about the purpose of me wearing my shirt, while trying to compassionately listen until I just couldn’t take it anymore. We argued for a good bit, and I pointed out the irony in his shirt while he repeatedly spewed hate my way, but eventually I went home and tried to look up some stats in order to better prepare myself for when(not “if,” but WHEN this happens again)...and was hitting roadblocks.

Does anyone have any advice/knowledge that I could use to counter an argument about planned parenthood as it’s related to BLM? (I bright up adoption, Foster care, systematic racism as how it can lead to more women of color needing adoration, but overall felt misinformed)

‘The computer was dropped off at a repair shop in Biden’s home state of Delaware in April 2019, according to the store’s owner.

The majority of the books I've devoured have been neo-liberal Austrian economics books. I'm finding a few things that aren't adding up, while also finding a few things that do like Medicare for All, Social Safety Nets, carbon taxes, Universal Basic Income, free immigration - all advocated by Friedman, Hayek, Mises, etc. At any rate, I'd like to know more about progressivism and am hunting for some good books and any good answers to neo-liberal economic arguments against wealth distribution. Just wanna learn more!







On a related note, I come from a fairly religious background and what I've found is how many books exist for evangelism and engagement in religion in general. Furthermore, I've found how much the rest of America absolutely fucking HATES talking about politics in casual conversation if they can help it. Do any books exist that talk about encouraging deeper political engagement in our communities? Would love to know if there are political resources that can be as ""evangelical"" as religious cultures might be. Thanks!"

I know it gets brought up that this is an issue but I feel like it should be discussed more by the media as well as Democratic senators and representatives. I know Trump presents a new scandal every other day but this is one that is ongoing and in plain sight. How is the “by your own bootstraps” party able to justify this? The hypocrisy doesn’t surprise me but I’m trying to figure out how conservatives justify them holding official positions.

I think it accurately describes how different political systems work and how they each have their own flaws and strengths.

The Story:

An assignment is due for class. Each student has to submit an essay. The essay is to be collected and reviewed by the professor. There are three students we will focus on, Sally the wealthy, Billy the middle class, and Bobby the impoverished.

Capitalism:

The professor has full faith in his students to perform well. He asks them to hand in their essays without any instructions on how to hand in the document. Sally hands in her essay in a large beautiful binder. It stands out from the rest. Billy simply staples his together. Bobby has no staples or binder so he folds the edges and Hope's for the best. The professor has a box to collect the papers in. Sally's doesn't fit in the box, it has to sit on top, in constant view. Billy's fits in the box, and despite being jostled around stays together because it is stapled. Bobby's papers go everywhere, and half the assignment is crumpled and flies away in the wind when the box is opened. Sally does very well on the assignment, and other students start rumors that her big binder had gotten her the grade. Billy did OK as well. Bobby, with half his paper missing, failed the assignment.

Communism:

The professor has no faith that his students will perform well. He asks them to hand in their essays with strict guidelines around size, shape, the number of staples, and the even the front page details. All of the required supplies are provided. Seeing as there is no room for error, Sally, Billy, and Bobby all hand in a very similar looking paper. All are graded by a professor who doesn't seem to care about the content as much as they care about the material fitting the required guidelines. The content was not assessed properly, some papers essays looked like they hadn't even been opened. Bobby's was clearly not opened, and he wondered if the teacher knew that his family was poor and didn't bother to read it. He noticed Sally's also hadn't been opened and her grade was slightly higher. Everyone feels like no matter what they do their paths are already set for them.

Socialism:

The professor has some faith in his students but he knows he needs to intervene somewhat to make the papers easier to collect. He issues guidelines that all papers must be just that, paper. No binders, and they just be stapled, with staples made available. The rest is up to you. This made Sally happy because despite not being able to use her favourite style of binder, the professor never said anything about stylized pages. Her front and back page were lit up with beautiful inks, with designs that caught the eye. She also used thin plastic sheets to cover it from damage. It was a little more difficult to do than a binder, but it worked. Billy staples his and hands it in. Bobby forgot to staple his. The professor, once again not trusting his students entirely, collected the pages into a very specific sized box. The box was the same size as the paper, which is why he asked that no one use a binder. He then placed all the paper into the box, closed it, and shook the box. He shook it upside down, sideways, then opened it up again. The pages all looked the same, non had moved because his box was the perfect size to hold the papers in place. No papers were lost. Sally received top grades, her effort was obvious and effective. Billy did OK. And Bobby? Bobby had written the next great american novel."

And how do you guys think the Trump era will affect the GOP in the post Trump era? When the GOP struggle to regain much of the public trust lost during the Trump presidency? Or will it be business as usual?

And how will this affect the Democrats? Will they enjoy any kind of benefit because of 4 years of trump?"

What's the future like for CA?,5,j7pwep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/j7pwep/whats_the_difference_between_liberalism_in_new/,10,1602235389.0,"I am a Californian and I have been exposed to some right wing medias saying what a dump California has become and it is becoming more and more of a ""dystopia"". I do not disagree completely with them. I live in Los Angeles and I do want to move out in the future because I want to own a house. But if I am rich enough, I will prefer to stay. 

The homeless and substance abuse issues are rampant. I lived on the streets for 2 months I got robbed twice, and people around me were like they were all on something. Either meth, heroin, coke, or alcohol. Santa Monica is becoming dirtier, and Venice smells. South Bay is doing fine though (cuz they don't belong to city of LA). The underpasses are filled with tents. But if we think this way: if we don't take care of them and accept them, where are they gonna go? South Dakota? New Hampshire? Where the winters are brutal and snow is waist deep? Or Florida? Where the bugs and rain and humidity could drive you crazy? It's been five months I haven't seen a single raindrop here and we still wear shorts and t shirt during the day. 

However I feel like New England is doing kinda fine and people are not leaving in droves. Is it because there is less of a drug epidemic problem? Is it because of the weather and less crazies? Right wing medias keep focusing on deteriorating cities run by liberals (and I agree things are not getting better here at the moment), however there are a ton of rather successful liberal states and cities such as the ones in New England. Recreational marijuana is legal, abortion rights protected, people are more educated (Portland Maine is the most educated city in the US). Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, NJ and NY are even sanctuary states just like California. Texas is doing fine however they have Mississippi and Alabama in states run by conservatives. **If you look at suicide rates among states, conservative states usually have higher suicide rates than liberal states. Out of 10 states with the lowest suicide rates, only 1 is a conservative state (Texas). Out of 10 states with the highest suicide rates, only 2 are liberal states (New Mexico and Nevada).**

What is going wrong with California? Yes the trash is piling up on the streets, businesses are closing, people are being unemployed, more people are leaving the state than coming in. What can California learn from New England? It is such a beautiful state, what is the future going to be like for California? Are we going to become a sanctuary for so called ""dysfunctional individuals"" (like me lol) cuz we have the best weather and better economy? What if the rich leave? Or will they?

For me I **strongly** suggest the state of California to mandate mandatory treatment for people with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or bi-polar, even depression. Especially schizophrenia. Or mandatory rehabilitation for heroin and meth addicts ***who are prone to commit violent crimes.*** Definitely not all of them cuz almost everyone in LA have used hard drugs in their lives."

I was unsurprised to see the media false shock at Trump's behavior (they CAN'T still be surprised by this by this point...  Anyone could see it coming a mile away, Trump being the pig and bully he is...) but there was one comment (from a Republican Biden supporter) that stuck with me...

(Paraphrased)

""Biden won this debate.  The job of a sitting President running for re-election is to convince the nation they want 4 more years of what he has to offer.  All Trump did was create exhaustion.""

Basically, this seems correct.  Nothing Trump did will excite people to vote for him.  He's behind in the polls, and this will do nothing to turn that around.  It may even cause him to fall further behind..."

V4GG is focusing on educating young people as to why it is important to vote, how they can get registered, and what some of the biggest issues facing the nation are so that they can enter the polls (or mail their ballot!) informed and excited about voting this year. We will be holding weekly virtual events, hosting voter registration virtual office hours, collaborating with other organizations, as well as releasing some new GGI policy solutions for the six weeks leading up to Election Day 2020.

We are hosting our kickoff webinar surrounding the importance of voting on Wednesday, September 23rd at 5:00 PM EST, and we would love to see some people from the Liberal subreddit there! The RSVP link for the event is bit.ly/v4ggkickoff, and the event will feature panelists from several youth-engagement and voter mobilization organizations.

Chris Wallace moderates the first. I don't think Trump is preparing for the debate in any way based on what I've read. Biden stated he wants to be a fact checker on the debate stage. 90 minutes long.

The VP debate is moderated by Susan Page, Washington bureau chief USA Today. 90 minutes long.

The 2nd debate is moderated by Steve Scully, political editor of CSPAN. 90 minutes long. It's a town hall format in Miami.

The 3rd debate is moderated by Kristen Welker, NBC News White House correspondent and co-anchor of Today Weekend. 90 minutes long."

RBG would be ashamed of many of you with this losers mindset. Let me take this opportunity to remind you that there are a lot of Republican senators fighting for their political careers. Many who have already come out to support ramrodding a justice nominee through. This could very well be the deciding factor that tips the senate and presidency to Democrats. I have got to believe there is a segment of moderate and independent voters in many states who are really sick of this D.C. political crap. People like McConnell and Graham can say whatever they want, but I think a lot of people see right through this. This can backfire really bad for them. Their political calculus is that by supporting a conservative judge, they will keep their base, which they desperately need at all costs to even have a shot of winning re-election.

If Republicans move to nominate someone to replace RBG on the Court, Joe Biden needs to make it clear that he will impose expanding the Supreme Court and the lower courts. This needs to be a rallying cry for Democrats that this type of behavior is unacceptable and there will be consequences. For the love of God, I want **SOMEONE** in this damn party to grow a set and say enough of this shit. Rolling over and dying is completely unacceptable and this type of mindset is a big part of the reason why Democrats get their asses handed to them in elections.

If the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg isn't enough of a shot in the arm to galvanize Democratic support and put Biden in the White House, then you know what? I hope they do overturn Roe v. Wade, gay marriage, voting rights, etc. because I'm so done feeling sorry for people who won't fight for the things they say are important to them. I'm a straight, married, white, and college educated. I have excellent healthcare. I own my own home. I have it better than many Americans do and I know that, which is why I try to champion those causes to improve the lives of people around me, but I'll be damned if I'm going to keep busting my ass for people who just want to roll over and die when things don't go their way. I want to see someone with passion and guts fight for the future of this country instead of hoping it will be the next generation. Screw that shit.

For the love of Almighty God, **STAND UP AND FIGHT THIS NONSENSE!!!**"

860,The AvengeHer Plan,1,iw278v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/iw278v/the_avengeher_plan/,2,1600583688.0,"(First, abolish the filibuster.)

1. The lower circuit courts of appeals have a wild disparity in number of judges in relation to population. The 11th circuit has one judge for every 2.7 million people while the 10th circuit has one judge for every 1.4 million. This should be made uniform, 1 judge for every million people in a circuit, with a circuit capped at 21 judges with a minimum of 11. Every ten years after the census the courts should be expanded to account for population growth.
2. That means that there should be approximately 332 appeals court judges not 179. This should be spread over 16 circuit courts not 12 plus the Federal and DC Circuit courts which should be brought up to the maximum of 21 judges. This means we need to confirm 172 new appeals court judges to bring population balance to the appeals courts.
3. The Supreme Court use to have a judge to account for each circuit court. Today each Supreme Court Justice is assigned a circuit court to cover with some having to cover multiple courts. This is an unreasonable burden to place on the justices so the court should be expanded so there is one Supreme Court justice for every circuit court.
4. That means there should be 18 Supreme Court Justices and we'll need to confirm an additional 9 justices to meet the requirements of the new law. Every ten years after the census a Supreme Court member will be added to account for any growth in the circuit courts.

We will be establishing some much needed equal representation to the circuit courts and returning the Supreme Court to its traditional role of representing the size of the circuit courts. It's a reasonable plan based on tradition and equality of representation. Also Fuck Mitch McConnell."

Be sure to keep repeating those total bullshit lies to yourselves over the next few decades, every time the old white guy who replaces Ginsburg, rules oppositely of how she would have and sets social progress back decades.

Just remember to look on the bright side; at least you didn’t have to suffer through a Hillary Clinton presidency.

Yes, it was your right to refuse to vote for her, either by voting 3rd party or not voting at all, but like all other freedoms, the right to vote does not mean freedom from social consequences.

#VOTE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE
---
####Mail-In Voting aka Absentee Voting

As of today, MN, VA, SD and WY join PA in beginning early voting to defeat the most dangerous President in history. Make no mistake, this is the most important election of our lives. Nearly all states have expanded mail-in voting eligibility to all citizens, with most states automatically mailing ballots or ballot applications to everyone. If you have not received one, [request your absentee ballot now.](https://www.vote.org/) Nearly all states have waved any requirements for witness/notary for mail-in ballots this election, **however MO has not!** If you live in MO, make a plan now on how to safely vote. (If you know of any other states that have restrictions on voting, please share details in the comments.)

####In-Person Voting

Early voting has begun! Most states are strongly discouraging in-person voting this election due to the pandemic. Check your local state's websites to see if in-person early voting is still available, as many states have switched to mail-in ballot drop-off only. If you choose to vote in-person, first check your voter registration, polling place and any other voting requirements in your state such as an ID. [Currently, most states can request and some require a form of ID to vote in-person.](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx)

####Register to Vote

Voter registration is still open for all 50 states. The first states begin closing voter registration starting Oct 4th, so don't wait! If you haven't yet, now is the time to register, and get your friends and family registered too: https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/

####Election Protection

If you experience harassment, intimidation, or anyone trying to prevent you from voting, report it to Election Protection Hotline (866-687-8683) immediately. No matter what, under federal law you always have the right to cast a provisional ballot, so there is no reason not to try and vote. Make sure you're at the right polling location: in 27 states, if you cast a provisional ballot at the wrong polling location, your vote will not be counted.

TL/DR: Basically, the main point is that not even a Utopian government could be successful w/ out the full support of all citizens. 

There are forms of gov’t that are inferior. For instance, one run by potatoes would not be very successful. Thereby, there are some forms of gov’t that are superior. In spite of those facts, I am sure that ABSOLUTELY NO gov’t could be perfectly successful unless every single citizen was in full support and cooperation of it. 

I personally believe that the only form of government worth supporting is a Theocracy. I believe it is the only solution to all of mankind’s problems. I believe it will eliminate hunger, sickness and crime; unite the world in peace; and so much more. However, I do not believe that a future gov’t RULED BY GOD would even be successful without the support of its citizens. 

That being said, I believe this is an entirely unpopular view because most people feel that “if only” they could get their country to govern itself to suit their tastes THEN the problems would be solved. I think this is small minded and quite ignorant, regardless of whether you’re on the right or left. 

And before you go attacking me for bringing God info this, just realize that that was not my point - it was only a detail to emphasize my personal conviction in the bold print above. I know that, with this audience, God is an unpopular belief in and of itself, so set that aside. 

And finally, I didn’t say Theocracy in general. I said “A” Theocracy. But that’s not even my main point. So don’t go Googling failed Theocracies and telling me to move there haha."

Has there always been this much of a media push in advance of a general election? I certainly don't remember it in 08, 12, and 16 (the three elections I've been old enough to follow).

Obviously these are different times. Some of these, like the NBA, have a somewhat obvious base and these ads seem implicitly anti-Trump. But some, like an NBC News, are more neutral. I'm just curious if these are normal or if this is a new phenomenon."

One of the big things the Biden campaign is doing, and every campaign since 1940, is calling swing voters.  They try to talk them into voting one way or the other but I’ve found that some of my republican friends are on the edge. They are swing voters and I know a lot of you have them in your friends and family. 

Start the discussion with them. Ask them over for a social distancing beer outside or whatever. Don’t jump on them but talk. 

There’s a ton of people who are like this and a lot of them don’t pay attention to trump every day or whatever and it’s been a long 4 years people forget all the shit he’s done. Shoot I forget a lot of it because it is so much. 


Also to add on this, a lot of people are one issue voters and you can create a one issue stance if a person doesn’t have one with climate change. 

Trump is ruining the planet and it should be a bigger issue but it’s not. Plus a lot of republicans are outdoors men so it could swing their vote. 


It’s worth a shot some of these people will just go vote and vote for trump because they are republican. Let’s stop the old republican catchphrase of “don’t talk about politics in public” and get a real debate going."

My other is moderately conservative on a lot of issues. I know she voted for Trump in 2016, but she has expressed unhappiness at how covid is being handled. She takes it very seriously and even quit her job due to how terribly the company was handling the virus. 

Anyway it came up in conversation (via text) and she told me she is voting for Trump this November. I'm not terribly surprised. I knew there was a chance she would be sticking with the conservative party. But...I just feel really sad and disheartened. For a lot of  reasons. I worry so much about what is happening to our country and the world because of that man.

Hundreds of thousands of Biden ballots might go uncounted due to mismatching signatures, mail delays, and other issues. That could EASILY tip the election. Why risk your vote not being counted in the most important election ever in this country, unless you are at significant risk if you get COVID? Why be one of the potentially 1 in 10 Biden voters whose vote does not get counted? 

People wait in lines at the grocery store and Walgreens...why is it any riskier to wait in a line at the booth where people will presumably already be spaced 6 feet apart and where masks might be required anyway? This should be a huge news issue but most people aren’t even realizing there could be 230,000+ Biden ballots not counted [47% of Biden voters said they may vote by mail (there will probably be over 50 million Biden votes, so 23.5 million mail Biden votes), and 1/10th of those would be around or over 230k].

They say we want to disband police departments (and that we hate the police): we don’t, that’s a lie. We want to weed out racism and unnecessary police brutality and for those who abuse their power to be held accountable.

They say we want to release all prisoners: we don’t, that’s a lie. We want to weed out racism and ensure the punishments match the crimes and to deprivatize prisons.  

They say we want open borders: we don’t, that’s a lie.  We want asylum seekers to be given their chance to seek asylum.  We want to help people who are coming from unimaginable terror and poverty help to give them the chances we have.   We want to ensure children aren’t separated from their parents and that nobody is kept in cages.  But we do want proper vetting. 

They say we want to take away your guns: we don’t, that’s a lie.  We want logical gun control to help prevent mass shootings. 

They say we want to wage a war on Christianity and Christian values: we don’t, that’s a lie.  We want people of all religions to be able to practice and worship freely. 

They say we want to get everything for free: we don’t, that’s a lie.  We want to work hard and make sure that healthcare and education are affordable for all.  

They say we want a war against traditional marriage:  we don’t, that’s a lie.  We want people of all sexual orientations to be able to love freely, no matter who you love. 

They say we want to destroy or rewrite history: we don’t, that’s a lie.  We want to recognize the ugly parts of our past and do everything we can to say “that’s not okay, let’s not honor those aggressors, let’s not let those things happen again”.

They say we want to take away your constitutional rights: we don’t, that’s a lie.  We choose to believe science and wear masks and try to prevent the spread of this disease. 

They say we support looters, rioters, and vigilantes: we don’t, that’s a lie.  We abhor that and support peaceful protests. 

They say we hate America:  we don’t, that’s a lie. We just recognize our faults and want us to do better, be better. 

Stop with the us vs. them.  Stop with the straw man arguments.  Stop with the fake news.  Stop with fox news.  Our position is one of empathy, compassion and logic.  Stop believing the hype. Stop with the division.   Just because we want equality for all doesn’t mean we want to take anything away from you."
